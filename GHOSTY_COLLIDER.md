# GHOSTY COLLIDER — Creative Phantom Collision Engine

> **Collide the ghosts of concepts to birth things that don't yet exist.**

Standard brainstorming: "Problem → Generate ideas."
GHOSTY COLLIDER: "Fragments → Strip labels → Collide → Wait for emergence."

**You don't think your way to a vision. You wait for it to appear.** That's why it's called a phantom collision.

---

## Theoretical Foundation

GHOSTY COLLIDER is grounded in three established creativity theories, re-engineered as an executable protocol:

| Theory | Author | Core Insight | How GHOSTY COLLIDER Applies It |
|--------|--------|-------------|-------------------------------|
| **Bisociation** | Arthur Koestler (1964) | Creativity occurs when an idea is perceived simultaneously in two self-consistent but habitually incompatible frames of reference | **Ghost Extraction** strips the original frame; **Collision Matrix** forces intersection of incompatible frames |
| **Lateral Thinking** | Edward de Bono (1967) | Breaking dominant patterns enables creative leaps; provocation disrupts habitual thought | **Ghost化 (de-labeling)** is a systematic provocation — removing the familiar name forces lateral perception |
| **Geneplore Model** | Finke, Ward & Smith (1992) | Creativity = Generate (pre-inventive structures) → Explore (interpret & refine) | Steps 1-3 = Generate phase; Steps 4-5 = Explore phase |

**What makes GHOSTY COLLIDER different from these theories:**
These theories describe *how creativity works*. GHOSTY COLLIDER prescribes *how to make it happen on demand*, as a repeatable 5-step protocol. The key innovation is **Ghost Extraction** — systematically reducing concepts to their deep structure (verbs, forces, transformations) before collision, which dramatically increases the probability of non-obvious connections.

## How It Differs from Other Methods

| | Brainstorming | SCAMPER | TRIZ | Design Thinking | **GHOSTY COLLIDER** |
|---|---|---|---|---|---|
| **Input** | Problem/prompt | Existing product | Technical contradiction | User need | **Raw fragments (anything)** |
| **Process** | Free association within a frame | Systematic modification | Inventive principles lookup | Empathize → Define → Ideate | **De-label → Collide structures** |
| **Strength** | Volume of ideas | Structured iteration | Engineering problems | Human-centered design | **Non-obvious connections across domains** |
| **Weakness** | Stays within familiar frames | Bounded by existing form | Domain-specific | Requires user research | Requires diverse fragments |
| **Output** | List of ideas | Modified product concepts | Technical solutions | Validated prototypes | **Named vision of something that doesn't exist yet** |
| **Core verb** | "Think" | "Modify" | "Solve" | "Empathize" | **"See"** |

**When to use GHOSTY COLLIDER over others:**
- You have fragments from **different domains** that seem unrelated
- You want **conceptual leaps**, not incremental improvements
- You're looking for **what doesn't exist yet**, not fixing what does
- The question is "What *could* be?" not "What *should* be?"

## The Ghost Protocol (5 Steps)

### Step 1: Fragment Harvest

Collect fragments. **Anything qualifies.**

Harvest targets:
- 📊 **Data & metrics** — revenue trends, KPIs, market data
- 👁️ **Observations** — user behavior, competitor moves, tech shifts
- 🫠 **Gut feelings** — "Something feels off about this," "This bugs me"
- 🎨 **Aesthetic impressions** — "I love this design," "This atmosphere"
- 🚫 **Absences** — "Why doesn't this exist?"
- 💭 **Personal experiences** — travel, conversations, failures, successes
- ⛓️ **Constraints** — budget, tech limitations, regulations, headcount

Minimum 3 fragments, ideal 5. **The more unrelated they are, the better.**

---

### Step 2: Ghost Extraction (De-labeling)

**Strip each fragment of its label and extract the deep structure (Ghost).**

This is the most critical step. Labels keep you inside existing frames. Remove them.

Procedure:
1. Write the fragment's name (label)
2. Ask: "What is this, fundamentally?"
3. Describe using only structure — no proper nouns, no industry jargon

```
Fragment: "Gacha mechanics"
  ↓ Ghost Extraction
Ghost: "A device that converts uncertainty into pleasure"

Fragment: "Solo camping boom"
  ↓ Ghost Extraction
Ghost: "Seeking fulfillment through controlled solitude"

Fragment: "DAU declining slowly but return rate is high"
  ↓ Ghost Extraction
Ghost: "Not desertion but pilgrimage — a place people want to return to"
```

### Ghost Extraction Quality Checklist:
- ✅ **Uses verbs**: Structure reads as "X transforms Y into Z"
- ✅ **Includes emotion**: Not just function but what the experiencer *feels*
- ✅ **No jargon**: A person from a completely different industry would understand it
- ✅ **Reversible test**: Try writing "NOT [Ghost]" — if it reveals something new, the Ghost is deep enough
- ❌ **Too shallow**: If the Ghost is just a synonym of the label, go deeper

---

### Step 3: Collision Matrix

**Intentionally collide extracted Ghosts against each other.**

You don't need all combinations. Search for **structural resonance**:
- Deep structures that are **similar** (despite surface-level irrelevance)
- Deep structures that are **opposite** (creates tension/energy)
- One Ghost **fills the gap** that another has

Collision Scoring:
| Score | Meaning | Action |
|-------|---------|--------|
| 💤 Boring | Surface AND structure are similar | Discard |
| 🤔 Interesting | Structural overlap exists | Hold |
| ⚡ Electric | Surface is unrelated BUT structure resonates/clashes | **Advance** |

**Only ⚡ Electric collisions proceed to Step 4.**

---

### Step 4: Vision Crystallization

From ⚡ Electric collisions, **something emerges**. This thing existed in neither Fragment A nor Fragment B. It was born from the collision.

For each emergence:
1. **Name** — Give the unnamed thing a name
2. **One Line** — "[Name] is a [thing] that [does what] for [whom]"
3. **Feel** — What would someone experiencing this feel? (1-2 emotion words)
4. **Image** — Describe one concrete scene cinematically
5. **Why Now?** — Why is this possible now? Why couldn't it have been done before?

```
👻 VISION: [Name]

"[One Line]"

Feel: [Emotion]
Image: [Concrete cinematic scene description]
Why Now: [Reason this is timely]
```

---

### Step 5: Reality Bridge

Visions are beautiful, but beauty alone isn't enough. **If you said "create," you must build a bridge to reality.**

- **Minimum Viable Vision (MVV)**: What's the smallest thing that reproduces this experience?
- **Existing Capability**: What current tech/resources/skills get us closest?
- **Kill Conditions**: What would kill this? (Tech impossibility, no market, legal barriers)
- **First Step**: What can be done starting tomorrow?

## Quality Metrics for Visions

Rate each Vision on these 4 dimensions:

| Dimension | Question | Score |
|-----------|----------|-------|
| **Novelty** | Does this exist already? Could you Google it? | ⭐1-5 (5 = nothing like this exists) |
| **Feasibility** | Can the MVV be built with current technology? | ⭐1-5 (5 = buildable today) |
| **Resonance** | Does this make someone say "I want that"? | ⭐1-5 (5 = immediate emotional pull) |
| **Timing** | Is there a reason this should happen *now*? | ⭐1-5 (5 = clear window of opportunity) |

**Threshold:** A Vision must score ≥ 3 on all four dimensions to advance to Reality Bridge. If any dimension scores 1, the Vision is discarded or recycled as a new Fragment.

**Sweet spot:** Novelty ≥ 4 AND Feasibility ≥ 3 — this is the zone where innovation meets execution.

## Anti-Patterns (How This Goes Wrong)

| Anti-Pattern | Symptom | Fix |
|-------------|---------|-----|
| **Shallow Ghosting** | Ghost is just a synonym of the label ("Gacha" → "Random reward system") | Go deeper. Ask "Why does this *feel* the way it does?" not just "What is this?" |
| **Electric Inflation** | Every collision is scored ⚡ | Be ruthless. If you can explain the connection in 2 seconds, it's 🤔 at best. ⚡ should surprise you. |
| **Vision Without Grounding** | Beautiful concept but no Reality Bridge | Never skip Step 5. A vision you can't MVV is a daydream. |
| **Homogeneous Fragments** | All fragments come from the same domain | Demand diversity. "Give me something from outside your industry." |
| **Forced Collision** | Connecting fragments that don't actually resonate, just to produce output | It's OK to report "No ⚡ Electric collisions found. Try different fragments." |
| **Why Now = Never** | Vision sounds cool but could have been done anytime | If the answer to "Why Now?" is "no reason," it's a Watch at best. |
