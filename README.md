> **Three executable protocols for creative emergence, strategic foresight, and typicality destruction.**

**👻 GHOSTY COLLIDER** strips concepts down to their deep structure, collides them, and crystallizes things that don't yet exist.

**🔮 PRECOG PROTOCOL** reads scattered signals, reverse-engineers structural shifts, and produces multi-axis timing judgments for strategic action.

**🔨 MOLD BREAKER** takes existing ideas, destroys their typicality bias, and forces them into structurally novel territory.

They work independently. They work even better together.

## 💡 Why These Exist

| Problem | What people do | What these protocols do |
|---------|---------------|----------------------|
| "We need new ideas" | Brainstorm within existing frames | **Strip labels first**, then collide deep structures across domains |
| "When should we move?" | Gut feeling + one-axis analysis | **4-axis Timing Grid** with explicit confidence tags and bias elimination |
| "Our ideas are all boring" | Generate more of the same | **Force-discard the obvious 3**, keep only what's structurally novel |
| "Connect the dots" | Pattern matching on surface similarities | **Ghost Extraction** reveals hidden structural resonance between unrelated concepts |

## 🚀 Quick Start

### 👻 GHOSTY COLLIDER — "What doesn't exist yet?"

```
1. Collect 3-5 fragments (data, observations, feelings — anything)
   → Pre-flight diversity check: minimum 2 distinct domains
2. Ghost Extraction: Strip labels → describe deep structure
3. Collision Matrix: Score structural resonance (💤 / 🤔 / ⚡)
4. Vision Crystallization: Name what emerges from ⚡ collisions
5. Reality Bridge: MVV + Kill Conditions + First Step
```

### 🔮 PRECOG PROTOCOL — "When should we move?"

```
1. Signal Map: 3-5 signals with evidence + confidence tags
2. Convergence: Reverse-engineer structural shifts
3. Contrarian View: Challenge the obvious conclusion
4. Timing Grid: Market Phase × Competition × Readiness × External Window
   → Over-determination check: all-aligned = trigger escalated contrarian
5. Action Window: Now / Soon / Watch with specific triggers
```

### 🔨 MOLD BREAKER — "Break the obvious."

```
1. Generate 5 candidates (volume first)
2. Reject the first 3 obvious ones (forced discard with reasons)
3. Select top 2 + Hybrid (keep the structurally novel)
4. Apply 2 orthogonal frames (shift the axis)
5. Add a Killer Constraint (force the final edge)
```

## 📚 Academic Foundation

These are not ad-hoc frameworks. They formalize established theories into repeatable, executable protocols:

| Protocol | Theoretical Basis |
|----------|------------------|
| **GHOSTY COLLIDER** | Bisociation (Koestler 1964), Lateral Thinking (de Bono 1967), Geneplore Model (Finke, Ward & Smith 1992) |
| **PRECOG PROTOCOL** | Horizon Scanning (OECD/UNDP), Weak Signals Theory (Ansoff 1975), Scenario Planning (Shell/Wack 1970s) |
| **MOLD BREAKER** | Typicality Bias (Doshi & Hauser 2024), Constraint-based Creativity (Stokes 2005), Structural Analogy (Gick & Holyoak 1983) |

The key contribution is transforming descriptive theories ("how creativity works") into prescriptive protocols ("how to make it happen on demand").

## 🔀 When to Use Which

```
You have raw materials (data, experiences, feelings)
  → GHOSTY COLLIDER ("What do you see?")

You have a market/domain question about timing
  → PRECOG PROTOCOL ("When should we move?")

You have ideas but they're all conventional
  → MOLD BREAKER ("Break the mold.")

You have all three needs
  → PRECOG signals become GHOSTY fragments
  → GHOSTY visions go through MOLD BREAKER
  → Sharpened visions feed PRECOG action windows
```
