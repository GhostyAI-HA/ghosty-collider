# 👻 GHOSTY COLLIDER × 🔮 PRECOG PROTOCOL

> **Two executable protocols for creative emergence and strategic foresight.**

**GHOSTY COLLIDER** strips concepts down to their deep structure, collides them, and crystallizes things that don't yet exist.

**PRECOG PROTOCOL** reads scattered signals, reverse-engineers structural shifts, and produces multi-axis timing judgments for strategic action.

They work independently. They work even better together — Signals from PRECOG become Fragments for GHOSTY, and Visions from GHOSTY feed into PRECOG's Action Window.

## Why These Exist

| Problem | What people do | What these protocols do |
|---------|---------------|----------------------|
| "We need new ideas" | Brainstorm within existing frames | **Strip labels first**, then collide deep structures across domains |
| "When should we move?" | Gut feeling + one-axis analysis | **4-axis Timing Grid** with explicit confidence tags and bias elimination |
| "Connect the dots" | Pattern matching on surface similarities | **Ghost Extraction** reveals hidden structural resonance between unrelated concepts |

## Quick Start

### GHOSTY COLLIDER — "What doesn't exist yet?"

```
1. Collect 3-5 fragments (data, observations, feelings — anything)
2. Ghost Extraction: Strip labels → describe deep structure
3. Collision Matrix: Score structural resonance (💤 / 🤔 / ⚡)
4. Vision Crystallization: Name what emerges from ⚡ collisions
5. Reality Bridge: MVV + Kill Conditions + First Step
```

### PRECOG PROTOCOL — "When should we move?"

```
1. Signal Map: 3-5 signals with evidence + confidence tags
2. Convergence: Reverse-engineer structural shifts
3. Contrarian View: Challenge the obvious conclusion
4. Timing Grid: Market Phase × Competition × Readiness × External Window
5. Action Window: Now / Soon / Watch with specific triggers
```

## Academic Foundation

These are not ad-hoc frameworks. They formalize established theories into repeatable, executable protocols:

| Protocol | Theoretical Basis |
|----------|------------------|
| **GHOSTY COLLIDER** | Bisociation (Koestler 1964), Lateral Thinking (de Bono 1967), Geneplore Model (Finke, Ward & Smith 1992) |
| **PRECOG PROTOCOL** | Horizon Scanning (OECD/UNDP), Weak Signals Theory (Ansoff 1975), Scenario Planning (Shell/Wack 1970s) |

The key contribution is transforming descriptive theories ("how creativity works") into prescriptive protocols ("how to make it happen on demand").

## When to Use Which

```
You have raw materials (data, experiences, feelings)
  → GHOSTY COLLIDER ("What do you see?")

You have a market/domain question about timing
  → PRECOG PROTOCOL ("When should we move?")

You have both
  → PRECOG signals become GHOSTY fragments
  → GHOSTY visions feed PRECOG action windows
```

## Part of HyperAION

These protocols were developed as part of [HyperAION](https://github.com/GhostyAI-HA/KG_Antigravity), an AI orchestration framework for knowledge work. They are designed to work standalone or as components in a larger AI agent workflow.
