# Contributing to GHOSTY COLLIDER & PRECOG PROTOCOL

Thank you for your interest in contributing! These protocols are designed to be practical and domain-agnostic. The best contributions make them sharper and more widely applicable.

## How to Contribute

### 1. New Examples (Most Welcome)

Apply GHOSTY COLLIDER or PRECOG PROTOCOL to your domain and share the results:

1. Fork this repository
2. Create a new file in `examples/` following the naming convention: `your_domain_topic.md`
3. Walk through the full protocol (all 5 steps)
4. Include a "What Made This Work" section explaining why specific steps produced non-obvious results
5. Submit a Pull Request

**Quality bar for examples:**
- At least one ⚡ Electric collision (GHOSTY) or one non-obvious Convergence (PRECOG)
- Ghost Extractions pass the Quality Checklist
- Vision scores ≥ 3 on all four dimensions (GHOSTY)
- All signals have proper confidence tags (PRECOG)

### 2. Protocol Refinements

If you've found ways to improve any step:
- Better heuristics for Ghost Extraction depth
- Additional Collision Scoring criteria
- New Timing Grid axes for PRECOG
- Improved anti-pattern detection

Open an Issue describing the refinement with at least one concrete example of how it improves output quality.

### 3. Translations

Help make these protocols accessible in more languages. Create a `translations/` directory with properly attributed files.
