# 🔮 PRECOG PROTOCOL — Signal-Based Foresight Engine

> **Read scattered signals. Reverse-engineer the structure. Cut through bias. Judge timing on multiple axes. Design action.**

Not trend-following. **Trend-reading.** The difference is the same as reading sheet music vs. feeling the song.

---

## 📚 Theoretical Foundation

PRECOG PROTOCOL synthesizes three established strategic foresight methodologies into a single executable protocol:

| Methodology | Origin | Core Insight | How PRECOG Applies It |
|-------------|--------|-------------|----------------------|
| **Horizon Scanning** | OECD, UNDP, UK Gov Office for Science | Systematically scan for early indicators of change across PESTEL dimensions | **Step 1 (Signal Map)** — structured signal collection with evidence and confidence tags |
| **Weak Signals Theory** | H. Igor Ansoff (1975) | Early, ambiguous hints of change are detectable before they crystallize into trends | **Step 2 (Convergence)** — connecting weak signals to reverse-engineer underlying structural shifts |
| **Scenario Planning** | Shell/Pierre Wack (1970s) | Don't predict one future; explore multiple plausible futures and prepare for each | **Step 3 (Contrarian)** — systematically challenging the dominant narrative to surface alternative futures |

**What makes PRECOG PROTOCOL different from these methodologies:**
These frameworks are designed for multi-week workshops with large teams. PRECOG compresses their core logic into a 5-step protocol executable in a single session, while adding two innovations:
1. **Timing Grid (Step 4)** — multi-axis timing judgment that no single framework addresses
2. **Signal History tracking** — longitudinal signal comparison across sessions, enabling cumulative foresight

## ⚔️ How It Differs from Other Strategic Frameworks

| | SWOT | PESTEL | Porter's 5 Forces | BCG Matrix | **PRECOG PROTOCOL** |
|---|---|---|---|---|---|
| **Focus** | Internal strengths/weaknesses + external opportunities/threats | Macro-environment scan | Competitive dynamics | Portfolio allocation | **Signal-based timing** |
| **Time horizon** | Present snapshot | Present-to-near-future | Present structure | Present portfolio | **Present signals → future inference** |
| **Bias handling** | None built-in | None built-in | None built-in | None built-in | **Contrarian View (Step 3) + explicit bias warnings** |
| **Timing judgment** | No | No | No | No | **Yes — 4-axis Timing Grid** |
| **Action output** | Generic recommendations | Environmental awareness | Strategy positioning | Invest/Divest | **Specific Now/Soon/Watch with triggers** |
| **Signal tracking** | No | No | No | No | **Yes — Signal History with deltas** |
| **Confidence levels** | No | No | No | No | **Yes — [Verified]/[Reported]/[Speculative] per signal** |

**When to use PRECOG vs. others:**
- SWOT → When you need a quick internal/external snapshot (static)
- PESTEL → When mapping macro-environmental factors (categorization)
- Porter's → When analyzing competitive structure (structure)
- PRECOG → **When the question is "When should we move?" or "What's about to change?"** (dynamic, timing-focused)

## 🔀 When to Use Which Protocol

| Your situation | Use | Why |
|-------------|----------------|-----|
| "I want to build X" (clear goal) | Standard brainstorming | Goal-driven → design |
| "Make this edgier" (improve existing) | Creative revision techniques | Banality destruction |
| **"What's happening in market X? When to move?"** | **→ PRECOG PROTOCOL** | **Signal → Analysis → Timing → Action** |
| "What do you see in these fragments?" (raw materials) | **[GHOSTY COLLIDER](./GHOSTY_COLLIDER.md)** | Fragments → Ghost → Collide → Vision |

**Rule of thumb:** If you ask about *timing* or *what's changing*, use PRECOG. If you hand over *materials* to create from, use GHOSTY COLLIDER.

## 🏷️ Confidence Tags (Mandatory on All Signals)

| Tag | Meaning | Criteria |
|-----|---------|----------|
| [Verified] | Confirmed fact | Official announcements, earnings reports, peer-reviewed papers, legislation |
| [Reported] | Multi-source reporting | Credible media coverage; primary source not directly accessed |
| [Speculative] | Hypothesis/inference | Extrapolation from individual cases, industry rumors, analysis |

## 🔬 The Precog Protocol (5 Steps)

### 📡 Step 1: Signal Map (3-5 Observable Signals)

Collect 3-5 **observable signals** related to the target theme.

Each signal requires:
- **Signal name**: One-line description of what's happening
- **Evidence**: Specific facts, data, or examples (with sources)
- **Direction**: ↑ Accelerating / → Stable / ↓ Decelerating
- **Confidence tag**: [Verified] / [Reported] / [Speculative]

Where to look for signals:
- **Numeric changes** — revenue, hiring, search volume, patent filings
- **Behavioral changes** — major player entries/exits, talent migration, investment shifts
- **Narrative changes** — media tone, conference topics, job posting language
- **Absent signals** — "Why *isn't* this happening?" is often the most important signal

---

### 🔍 Step 2: Convergence Analysis (Reverse-Engineering Structure)

Identify where multiple signals **intersect** and reverse-engineer the underlying structure.

Process:
- "Signal A + Signal C happening simultaneously → This structural shift is behind it"
- "Signal B and Signal D are moving in opposite directions → Tension/inflection point here"
- "Signal E is absent → This assumption is breaking down"

Narrow to 1-3 convergence points. For each:
- **Structural hypothesis**: What's happening (one sentence)
- **Causal logic**: Why these signals connect
- **Confidence**: High / Medium / Low + rationale

---

### 🔴 Step 3: Contrarian View (Bias Elimination)

For the most "obvious" conclusion, examine **why it might be wrong**.

Required:
- At least one reason it may be overestimated
- A historical analogy where a **similar setup led to a different outcome** (if available)
- **Preconditions**: "This hypothesis is valid only if [A] and [B] hold true"
- **Collapse scenario**: Which precondition, if broken, invalidates the entire thesis

```
🔴 Contrarian: [Mainstream view] may be wrong because:
- Reason 1: ...
- Reason 2: ...
- Historical parallel: [Case] → [Actual outcome]
- Preconditions: Valid only if [A] AND [B] hold
- Collapse trigger: If [C] occurs, this thesis fails
```

---

### ⏱️ Step 4: Timing Grid (Multi-Axis Timing Judgment)

"When to move" cannot be determined on a single axis. **Layer multiple timing dimensions.**

#### 4.1 Market Phase (Hype Cycle Axis)

| Phase | Characteristics | Guideline |
|-------|----------------|-----------|
| 🌱 Emergence | Experimental, low awareness | Research & small experiments |
| 📈 Acceleration | Rapid adoption, investment surge | Aggressive entry |
| 🏔️ Peak Hype | Overinflated expectations, bubble-like | Caution, focus on differentiation |
| 📉 Correction | Disillusionment, shakeout | Winner selection, bargain entry |
| 🏗️ Plateau | Established, mature | Efficiency optimization |

#### 4.2 Competitive Timing Axis

| Position | Meaning | Decision Criteria |
|----------|---------|-------------------|
| 🏃 First Mover | Move first | Market-defining opportunity, high risk |
| 🎯 Fast Follower | Leverage first mover's lessons | Enter right after market is proven |
| 🏰 Fortifier | Late but resourced to dominate | Enter after winning patterns emerge |
| ⏳ Too Late | Window has closed | Retreat or niche-specialize |

#### 4.3 Organizational Readiness Axis

| Level | State | Required Action |
|-------|-------|----------------|
| 🔴 Not Ready | Missing people/tech/capital | Build foundation first |
| 🟡 Partially Ready | Some pieces in place | Fill gaps in parallel with small starts |
| 🟢 Ready | Can execute now | Go |

#### 4.4 External Window Axis

Often overlooked but critical:
- **Regulatory window**: Pre/post legislation or deregulation
- **Capital window**: Fundraising market temperature (cold vs. overheated)
- **Seasonal/Event**: Industry conferences, fiscal year budget cycles, competitor release timing
- **Technology maturity**: GA (General Availability) date of dependency technologies

#### 4.5 Timing Grid Output

```
| Axis | Current Position | Judgment |
|------|-----------------|----------|
| Market Phase | 📈 Acceleration | Go-leaning |
| Competitive | 🎯 Fast Follower | Go |
| Org Readiness | 🟡 Partially Ready | Conditional Go |
| External Window | Regulation easing Q2 2026 [Reported] | Soon |
| → Overall | **Conditional Go** — [Explicit conditions] |
```

---

### 🎯 Step 5: Action Window

Based on the Timing Grid, specify **when to do what**.

Three categories:
- **Now**: Low-cost actions to start immediately (1-2)
- **Soon**: Invest when conditions are met (1-2)
- **Watch**: Don't move yet, but trigger on these signals (1-2)

Each action requires:
- **WHO**: Responsible person/team
- **WHAT**: Specific action
- **TRIGGER**: Execution condition (especially for Soon/Watch)
- **COST**: Estimated cost/resources (if known)

---

## 📊 Signal History (Longitudinal Signal Tracking)

When analyzing the same theme across multiple sessions, compare with previous Signal Maps.

### Delta Detection Procedure

1. **Load previous Signal Map**
2. **Judge each signal's change**:

| Change | Meaning |
|--------|---------|
| 📈 Strengthened | Direction accelerated or confidence upgraded |
| → Stable | No change |
| 📉 Weakened | Direction decelerated or confidence downgraded |
| 🆕 New | Not in previous analysis |
| 💀 Dead | Was in previous but has been invalidated |

3. **Prioritize 🆕 and 💀 signals in Convergence Analysis** — new appearances and disappearances are the strongest evidence of structural change.

## 🔄 Prediction Feedback Loop

Track the accuracy of past predictions to improve future analysis quality.

### After each prediction materializes (or fails to):

```
## Prediction Review: [Theme] (Original: YYYY-MM-DD)
| # | Prediction | Actual Outcome | Verdict | Why |
|---|-----------|---------------|---------|-----|
| 1 | "X will accelerate by Q2" | X did accelerate | ✅ Hit | Signal reading was correct |
| 2 | "Y market will correct" | Y continued growing | ❌ Miss | Overlooked signal Z |
| 3 | "Entry window in Q3" | Window was Q2 | 🔶 Partial | Timing was off by 1Q |
```

### Tracking metrics:
- **Hit Rate**: % of predictions that materialized as described
- **Timing Accuracy**: Average deviation between predicted and actual timing
- **Contrarian Value**: How often the Contrarian View turned out to be correct

**Use misses to refine future Signal Map construction** — each miss reveals a blind spot.

---

## 🚨 Anti-Patterns (How This Goes Wrong)

| Anti-Pattern | Symptom | Fix |
|-------------|---------|-----|
| **Confirmation Bias in Signal Selection** | Only collecting signals that support a pre-existing belief | Force at least one signal that contradicts your thesis. If you can't find one, your search is too narrow |
| **Single-Axis Timing** | "Market is hot, let's go!" without checking readiness or competition | Always complete the full 4-axis Timing Grid. One "Go" axis doesn't mean overall "Go" |
| **Vague Action Windows** | "Watch and see" / "Monitor the situation" without specific triggers | Every Watch item MUST have a concrete trigger: "If X happens, then do Y" |
| **Recency Bias** | Overweighting events from the last 2 weeks | Check: "Would I still select this signal if it happened 6 months ago?" |
| **Survivorship Bias** | Only citing successful cases in Convergence | In Contrarian View, actively search for failures in similar situations |
| **Speculative Masquerading as Verified** | Marking rumor-based signals as [Verified] | Strict rule: [Verified] = primary source accessible. If you can't link to the source, it's [Reported] at best |
