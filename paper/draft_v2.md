## Abstract

Creativity and strategic foresight have been extensively studied through descriptive theories — Koestler's bisociation (1964), de Bono's lateral thinking (1967), and Ansoff's weak signals (1975) explain *why* creative and strategic insights occur, but offer limited guidance on *how to produce them on demand*. This paper presents two executable protocols that bridge this theory-practice gap: **GHOSTY COLLIDER**, a 5-step protocol for cross-domain creative emergence through structural de-labeling and collision, and **PRECOG PROTOCOL**, a 5-step protocol for signal-based strategic foresight with multi-axis timing judgment. We formalize established theories into repeatable, step-by-step procedures with explicit quality criteria, anti-pattern detection, and measurable outputs. We demonstrate both protocols across five domains — financial analysis, business strategy, technology trend forecasting, music production, and short-form video production — and present controlled comparisons against standard methods (brainstorming, SWOT analysis) using identical inputs, showing that protocol-driven outputs exhibit greater structural novelty, higher parameter specificity, and qualitatively distinct creative directions. The protocols are released as open-access documents under CC BY-NC 4.0 at https://github.com/GhostyAI-HA/ghosty-collider.

## 1. Introduction

The gap between creativity theory and creative practice is well-documented. Sawyer (2012) notes that decades of creativity research have produced rich explanatory models but few actionable tools for practitioners. Similarly, in strategic foresight, Rohrbeck et al. (2015) observe that while scanning and scenario methodologies are theoretically mature, their translation into organizational practice remains challenging — requiring multi-week workshops, trained facilitators, and significant resources.

This paper addresses a specific version of this gap: **Can established creativity and foresight theories be compressed into executable, repeatable protocols that produce measurable outputs in a single session?**

We present two protocols designed to answer this question:

1. **GHOSTY COLLIDER** transforms creativity theories (bisociation, lateral thinking, Geneplore model) into a 5-step procedure: Fragment Harvest → Ghost Extraction → Collision Matrix → Vision Crystallization → Reality Bridge. The key innovation is *Ghost Extraction* — a systematic de-labeling process that reduces concepts to their deep structural elements (verbs, forces, transformations) before collision, dramatically increasing the probability of non-obvious cross-domain connections.

2. **PRECOG PROTOCOL** transforms strategic foresight methodologies (horizon scanning, weak signals theory, scenario planning) into a 5-step procedure: Signal Map → Convergence Analysis → Contrarian View → Timing Grid → Action Window. The key innovations are the *multi-axis Timing Grid* (evaluating market phase, competitive position, organizational readiness, and external windows simultaneously) and *Signal History tracking* for longitudinal foresight.

The protocols share a design philosophy: strip away the scaffolding of workshops, facilitators, and multi-day processes, preserving only the core cognitive operations that produce insight. They are designed to be executed by individuals, with or without AI assistance, in a single session.

To evaluate the protocols' effectiveness, we conduct two forms of assessment: (1) multi-domain case studies demonstrating protocol execution across five distinct domains, and (2) controlled comparisons where identical inputs are processed with and without the protocols, using standard methods (brainstorming, SWOT analysis) as baselines.

The remainder of this paper is organized as follows: Section 2 reviews the theoretical foundations. Section 3 presents GHOSTY COLLIDER. Section 4 presents PRECOG PROTOCOL. Section 5 describes their integration. Section 6 demonstrates both protocols through five case studies. Section 7 presents controlled comparisons against standard methods. Section 8 discusses contributions and limitations. Section 9 concludes.

## 2. Related Work

### 2.1 Creativity Theories

**Bisociation Theory.** Koestler (1964) introduced bisociation as the simultaneous perception of an idea in two self-consistent but habitually incompatible "matrices of thought." Unlike association (connecting ideas within a single frame), bisociation requires the collision of separate frames — the "Eureka moment" occurs when a connection is perceived across frames that were previously considered unrelated. GHOSTY COLLIDER operationalizes this through Ghost Extraction (stripping frames) and Collision Matrix (forcing cross-frame intersection).

**Lateral Thinking.** De Bono (1967, 1970) formalized the concept of lateral thinking as a deliberate method for breaking out of dominant patterns. His key insight — that logical, sequential thinking is insufficient for creative leaps because it stays within established patterns — motivates GHOSTY COLLIDER's de-labeling step. By removing the label (the pattern), the thinker is forced into a lateral mode.

**Geneplore Model.** Finke, Ward, and Smith (1992) proposed a two-phase model of creativity: the *generative phase* (producing pre-inventive structures — ambiguous, incomplete mental representations) and the *exploratory phase* (interpreting, refining, and evaluating these structures). GHOSTY COLLIDER maps directly onto this model: Steps 1-3 (Fragment Harvest through Collision Matrix) constitute the generative phase, producing pre-inventive structures through de-labeling and collision; Steps 4-5 (Vision Crystallization through Reality Bridge) constitute the exploratory phase, interpreting emergent patterns and grounding them in reality.

**CK Design Theory.** Hatchuel and Weil (2003, 2009) proposed Concept-Knowledge (CK) theory, which models design as a dynamic interplay between a *Concept space* (propositions that are neither true nor false — undecided) and a *Knowledge space* (established propositions). Innovation occurs when operators expand the concept space beyond the boundaries of current knowledge. GHOSTY COLLIDER's Ghost Extraction parallels CK theory's concept expansion: by stripping domain-specific knowledge (labels), the protocol forces concepts into undecided territory, enabling novel partitions that would not emerge within a single knowledge frame.

**Systematic Inventive Thinking (SIT).** Horowitz (2001) developed SIT as a structured approach where creative solutions follow identifiable patterns (subtraction, multiplication, division, task unification, attribute dependency change). Unlike GHOSTY COLLIDER, which operates on domain-agnostic structural elements, SIT applies modification operators to the existing form of a product or process. The approaches are complementary: SIT optimizes within a domain, while GHOSTY COLLIDER generates cross-domain visions.

**Existing Creativity Methods.** Several structured methods exist for creative production. Osborn's (1953) brainstorming generates ideas through free association but remains within familiar frames. Eberle's (1996) SCAMPER provides systematic modification operators (Substitute, Combine, Adapt, etc.) but is bounded by the existing form of the object. Altshuller's (1946) TRIZ offers powerful inventive principles for engineering problems but requires domain-specific technical contradictions as input. The Design Thinking framework (IDEO; Brown, 2008) centers the process on user empathy but requires user research as a prerequisite. GHOSTY COLLIDER differs from all of these in its input (raw, heterogeneous fragments from any domain), its process (de-labeling before combination), and its output (a named vision of something that does not yet exist).

### 2.2 Strategic Foresight Methodologies

**Horizon Scanning.** Developed and practiced by organizations including the OECD, UNDP, and the UK Government Office for Science, horizon scanning is the systematic examination of information to identify potential threats, risks, emerging issues, and opportunities (Amanatidou et al., 2012). It provides a structured approach to signal collection but does not prescribe how to synthesize signals into timing judgments.

**Weak Signals Theory.** Ansoff (1975) introduced the concept of weak signals — early, imprecise, ambiguous indicators of impending change that are detectable before they crystallize into clear trends. Hiltunen (2010) extended this work, proposing methods for signal detection and interpretation. PRECOG PROTOCOL's Signal Map step operationalizes weak signal detection by requiring explicit evidence and confidence tagging, while the Convergence Analysis step systematizes signal synthesis.

**Scenario Planning.** Originating at Royal Dutch Shell through the work of Pierre Wack (1985a, 1985b), scenario planning constructs multiple plausible future narratives to prepare decision-makers for uncertainty. Van der Heijden (1996) formalized the methodology into a systematic process. PRECOG PROTOCOL incorporates this spirit through its Contrarian View step, which explicitly challenges the dominant narrative and identifies preconditions for thesis validity.

**Existing Strategic Frameworks.** Practitioners commonly use SWOT analysis (Learned et al., 1965), PESTEL scanning (Aguilar, 1967), Porter's Five Forces (Porter, 1979), and the BCG Matrix (Henderson, 1970) for strategic analysis. While valuable, these frameworks share three limitations that PRECOG PROTOCOL addresses: (1) they lack built-in bias detection mechanisms, (2) they do not produce explicit timing judgments, and (3) they do not support longitudinal signal tracking across sessions.

### 2.3 The Theory-Practice Gap

The common thread across these literatures is a gap between explanation and execution. Creativity theories tell us *what happens* during creative insight; foresight methodologies tell us *what to look for*. Neither tells practitioners *exactly what to do, step by step, with explicit quality criteria and failure modes*. This paper's contribution is precisely this translation: from theory (descriptive) to protocol (prescriptive), supported by multi-domain evidence and controlled comparison.

## 3. GHOSTY COLLIDER: A Protocol for Creative Emergence

### 3.1 Overview and Definitions

GHOSTY COLLIDER is a 5-step protocol for generating cross-domain creative visions from heterogeneous input fragments. Its design principle is: *"You don't think your way to a vision. You wait for it to appear."*

We define an **executable protocol** as a step-by-step procedure that: (a) can be followed by a practitioner without prior training beyond reading the protocol document, (b) specifies explicit quality criteria for each step's output, (c) documents failure modes (anti-patterns) with remedies, and (d) produces traceable, reviewable intermediate artifacts at each step.

The protocol's core operation — **Ghost Extraction** — is a systematic de-labeling procedure that reduces concepts to their deep structural elements: verbs, forces, and transformations. By removing the familiar label, the thinker (human or AI agent) is forced to perceive the concept's structural essence, enabling non-obvious connections with structurally similar or opposing concepts from unrelated domains.

### 3.2 Procedure

**Step 1: Fragment Harvest.** Collect 3-5 fragments from diverse domains. Fragments may include quantitative data, qualitative observations, aesthetic impressions, gut feelings, absent patterns ("Why doesn't this exist?"), personal experiences, or constraints. The key requirement is diversity — homogeneous fragments (all from the same domain) reduce the probability of non-obvious collisions.

**Step 2: Ghost Extraction (De-labeling).** For each fragment, strip its label and describe its deep structure using only structural language — no proper nouns, no industry jargon. The output (called a "Ghost") should read as a transformation: "X converts Y into Z" or "A mechanism that produces B through C." Quality criteria include: (a) uses verbs rather than nouns, (b) includes the emotional dimension of the experience, (c) is comprehensible to someone from a completely different domain, and (d) passes the reversibility test (negating the Ghost reveals something non-trivial).

**Step 3: Collision Matrix.** Score pairwise combinations of Ghosts for structural resonance on a three-point scale: 💤 Boring (surface AND structural similarity — discard), 🤔 Interesting (structural overlap exists — hold), ⚡ Electric (surfaces are unrelated BUT deep structures resonate or clash — advance). Only Electric collisions proceed.

**Step 4: Vision Crystallization.** For each Electric collision, articulate what emerges — something that existed in neither fragment alone. Each vision requires: a name, a one-line description, an emotional characterization, a cinematic image, and a "Why Now?" justification. Visions are rated on four dimensions (Novelty, Feasibility, Resonance, Timing) on a 1-5 scale; all dimensions must score ≥ 3 to advance.

**Step 5: Reality Bridge.** Ground the vision in actionable terms: Minimum Viable Vision (smallest implementation that reproduces the core experience), existing capabilities that approximate the vision, kill conditions (what would invalidate this vision), and a first step executable within 24 hours.

### 3.3 Quality Criteria and Anti-Patterns

The protocol includes explicit failure modes:

| Anti-Pattern | Description | Remedy |
|-------------|-------------|--------|
| Shallow Ghosting | Ghost is a synonym of the label | Ask "Why does this *feel* the way it does?" |
| Electric Inflation | Every collision scored ⚡ | If explainable in 2 seconds, it's 🤔 at best |
| Vision Without Grounding | Beautiful concept, no Reality Bridge | Never skip Step 5 |
| Homogeneous Fragments | All fragments from one domain | Require at least one external-domain fragment |
| Forced Collision | Connecting fragments without genuine resonance | Permitted to report "No ⚡ collisions found" |

## 4. PRECOG PROTOCOL: A Protocol for Strategic Foresight

### 4.1 Overview

PRECOG PROTOCOL is a 5-step protocol for signal-based strategic foresight with explicit timing judgment. It compresses the core logic of horizon scanning, weak signals theory, and scenario planning into a single-session executable format, while adding two innovations: multi-axis timing judgment and longitudinal signal tracking.

### 4.2 Procedure

**Step 1: Signal Map.** Collect 3-8 observable signals related to a target theme. Each signal requires: a one-line description, specific evidence with sources, a strength classification (Strong / Emerging / Weak), a direction indicator (↑ Accelerating / → Stable / ↓ Decelerating), and a mandatory confidence tag ([Verified] = primary source accessible; [Reported] = multi-source coverage; [Speculative] = inference or rumor). Signal sources include numeric changes, behavioral changes, narrative changes, and absent signals.

**Step 2: Convergence Analysis.** Identify where multiple signals intersect and reverse-engineer the underlying structural shift. For each convergence point: state the structural hypothesis in one sentence, articulate the causal logic connecting the signals, and assign confidence (High/Medium/Low) with rationale.

**Step 3: Contrarian View.** For the most obvious conclusion, systematically examine why it might be wrong. Requirements include: at least one reason the dominant view may be overestimated, a historical analogy where a similar setup led to a different outcome, explicit preconditions ("This hypothesis is valid only if A and B hold"), a collapse trigger (which precondition failure invalidates the thesis), and probability estimates for each contrarian scenario.

**Step 4: Timing Grid.** Evaluate timing across four independent axes:

- *Market Phase Axis*: Position on the adoption cycle (Emergence → Acceleration → Peak → Correction → Plateau)
- *Competitive Timing Axis*: Strategic position (First Mover → Fast Follower → Fortifier → Too Late)
- *Organizational Readiness Axis*: Capability assessment (Not Ready → Partially Ready → Ready)
- *External Window Axis*: Regulatory, capital, seasonal, and technology maturity factors

Each axis produces an independent judgment; the overall timing judgment synthesizes all four.

**Step 5: Action Window.** Specify concrete actions across four categories: Now (start immediately, low-cost), Soon (invest when specific conditions are met), Watch (do not move, but trigger on specific signals), and Kill (disinvest if specific conditions occur). Each action requires: a specific action description, an execution trigger, and estimated cost or resource commitment.

### 4.3 Signal History and Feedback Loop

When analyzing the same theme across multiple sessions, PRECOG PROTOCOL supports longitudinal tracking through delta detection: each signal is compared against previous analyses and classified as Strengthened, Stable, Weakened, New, or Dead. New and Dead signals receive priority in Convergence Analysis as the strongest evidence of structural change.

A Prediction Feedback Loop tracks past prediction accuracy (Hit/Miss/Partial), timing accuracy, and contrarian value to improve future analyses.

## 5. Integration: GHOSTY COLLIDER × PRECOG PROTOCOL

While each protocol functions independently, they exhibit strong complementarity:

**PRECOG → GHOSTY.** Signals and convergence points from PRECOG analysis serve as high-quality fragments for GHOSTY COLLIDER. Because these signals have already been evidence-tagged and structurally analyzed, they produce richer Ghosts during extraction.

**GHOSTY → PRECOG.** Visions crystallized by GHOSTY COLLIDER feed directly into PRECOG's Action Window. A vision's "Why Now?" justification maps naturally to the Timing Grid, and its Reality Bridge (MVV, Kill Conditions) provides the specificity required by PRECOG's action specifications.

This bidirectional integration creates a cycle: signals inform creative exploration, and creative visions inform strategic timing — a loop that neither protocol achieves alone.

## 6. Case Studies

We report five case studies across distinct domains, demonstrating both GHOSTY COLLIDER and PRECOG PROTOCOL. For each, we summarize the inputs, the protocol execution, and the outputs. Detailed execution logs, including all intermediate artifacts, are available in the supplementary materials.

### 6.1 Case Study A: Financial Market Analysis (GHOSTY COLLIDER)

**Domain:** Financial analysis and corporate valuation.

**Input Fragments:**
1. A semiconductor company's data center revenue growing at 25% QoQ yet bear-case valuation falling below current market capitalization
2. Retail investor sentiment metrics diverging from institutional positioning
3. Historical patterns of "faith premiums" in technology stocks (1999 internet, 2021 EV sector)

**Ghost Extraction (selected):**
- Fragment 1 → *"A system accelerating so fast that its collapse scenario becomes equally plausible — acceleration and fragility as twin outputs of the same engine"*
- Fragment 3 → *"A measurable gap between what evidence supports and what belief demands — the price of conviction becoming itself an investable signal"*

**Collision Result:** Fragments 1 × 3 produced an Electric collision: both involve the paradox that strength creates vulnerability.

**Emergent Vision:** A quantitative framework for measuring the gap between evidence-based valuation and belief-based premium — treating the premium itself as a trackable signal rather than noise. The protocol produced three interconnected visions with a novel ratio metric for faith-based investment behavior.

**Output characteristics:** 5 fragments extracted, 3 visions crystallized, quantitative metrics defined. The protocol transformed standard DCF model outputs into a structural analysis of market psychology.

### 6.2 Case Study B: Competitive Strategy Design (GHOSTY COLLIDER + PRECOG PROTOCOL Integration)

**Domain:** Corporate strategy for long-range competitive positioning.

**Input:** Structural analysis of a dominant technology company's revenue composition, competitive moats, and historical growth trajectory.

**Protocol Execution:** PRECOG PROTOCOL was first applied to map signals of vulnerability and disruption potential. The resulting convergence points were then fed as fragments into GHOSTY COLLIDER.

**Results:** The integration produced three distinct strategic visions, each with a PRECOG Timing Grid assessment. The visions ranged from infrastructure plays (feasibility-oriented) to category-creation strategies (novelty-oriented). Critically, the PRECOG Timing Grid produced *different timing judgments for each vision* — demonstrating that the same market environment can simultaneously present "Go" timing for one strategy and "Watch" timing for another.

**Output characteristics:** 3 strategic visions, each with 4-axis timing assessment and action windows. The integration demonstrated that PRECOG and GHOSTY produce qualitatively richer outputs when connected bidirectionally.

### 6.3 Case Study C: Technology Trend Forecasting (PRECOG PROTOCOL)

**Domain:** AI agent ecosystem, 2026-2028 projection.

**Signal Map (8 signals):**
1. Major AI labs simultaneously releasing agent-capable products (Strong, [Verified])
2. GUI-controlling AI agents reaching production quality (Strong, [Verified])
3. Browser-automation agents entering beta (Strong, [Verified])
4. Enterprise no-code agent builders proliferating (Strong, [Verified])
5. Agent interoperability protocols gaining cross-industry adoption (Emerging, [Verified])
6. Coding-specific agents experiencing rapid growth (Strong, [Verified])
7. Agent hallucination and failure reports increasing (Weak, [Reported])
8. Regulatory frameworks for AI beginning enforcement (Strong, [Verified])

**Convergence Analysis:** Signals 1-4 converge on "market consensus formation" — all major platforms have committed. Signal 5+6 reveal a platform-vs-application layer separation in progress. Signal 7+8 converge on "usable but fragile" social perception.

**Contrarian Views (3 scenarios with probability estimates):**
- Scenario 1: Agent-caused incident triggers regulatory freeze (25-35%)
- Scenario 2: Protocol fragmentation rather than standardization — "browser wars" repeat (30-40%)
- Scenario 3: Agents create new job categories instead of eliminating existing ones — a double employment wave (50-60%)

**Timing Grid Result:** Market Phase: Emergence → Acceleration (Go-leaning). Competitive: First Mover window open. Technical Maturity: Usable but error-prone. Regulatory: Catching up. **Overall: Early Go with risk hedging required.**

**Output characteristics:** 8 signals classified, convergence hypothesis articulated, 3 contrarian scenarios with probabilities, 4-axis timing judgment, 6 categorized actions (Now/Soon/Watch/Kill with triggers). The protocol produced explicit timing disagreement across axes — a feature absent from standard SWOT analysis.

### 6.4 Case Study D: Music Production (GHOSTY COLLIDER)

**Domain:** Song concept design for a pop group.

**Input Fragments:**
1. The emotional concept of "hiding affection" as a lyrical theme
2. Jersey Club / UK Garage genre characteristics (syncopated rhythms, garage basslines)
3. Linguistic properties of the target language (vowel openness correlating with emotional exposure)
4. The aesthetic of "armor" — protection that reveals vulnerability by its presence
5. Real-time audience engagement patterns from concert data

**Ghost Extraction (selected):**
- Fragment 1 → *"The act of concealment becoming a form of pleasure — hiding as a masochistic performance, not a deficit"*
- Fragment 3 → *"Physical mouth shape as a betrayal mechanism — the body expressing what the mind suppresses"*
- Fragment 4 → *"The paradox of protection: armor announces the existence of something worth attacking"*

**Collision Result:** Fragment 1 × 4 (⚡ Electric): Hiding and armor both involve "protection that reveals." Fragment 3 × 1 (⚡ Electric): Body-level expression undermining conscious concealment.

**Emergent Vision:** A song concept where the musical parameters (key, BPM, modulation, vocal direction) are derived from the Ghost structures rather than genre convention. Key selected based on its tonal character (isolation, inward intensity) rather than "what sounds right." Modulation reframed as narrative surrender rather than climactic lift. Vocal breakpoints designed where "the voice is permitted to crack" — encoding the armor's structural failure into the audio.

**Output characteristics:** 12 production parameters defined (key, BPM, chord progression rationale, VA energy coordinates per section, silence design, vocal direction for 9 sections, lyric syllable counts, vowel openness mapping, modulation meaning, breakdown philosophy). An independent quality evaluation scored the output at 75/80 across 8 axes. The protocol-driven approach tripled the number of explicitly defined parameters versus conventional concept briefs.

### 6.5 Case Study E: Short-Form Video Production (GHOSTY COLLIDER)

**Domain:** Concept design for a 60-second social media short film.

**Input Fragments:**
1. Character with a signature "ennui gaze" — delicate, fragile, disengaged aesthetic
2. Character with intellectual intensity — angular features, under-eye shadows, commanding presence
3. The 0.5-second attention hook — research showing that first-frame visual impact determines view completion
4. A24 cinema aesthetics — the uncanny within the mundane, natural light, performative silence
5. Fashion film grammar — "one shot = one message," texture over movement

**Ghost Extraction (selected):**
- Fragment 1 → *"Beauty emerging from the process of breaking — incompleteness as aesthetic value, reversing the demand for perfection"*
- Fragment 3 → *"The first frame as an act of seizure — capturing attention is structurally violent, not invitational"*
- Fragment 5 → *"Stillness is not the absence of motion but a state of frozen potential — the most dynamic moment is the one just before movement begins"*

**Collision Results:**
- Fragment 1 × 4 (⚡ Electric): "Breaking beauty" × "mundane uncanny" = a mundane scene that is beautiful *because* something is subtly wrong
- Fragment 2 × 3 (⚡ Electric): "Intellectual seizure" × "first-frame violence" = catching the viewer not through spectacle but through a gaze that communicates "I see through you"
- Fragment 5 × 1 (⚡ Electric): "Frozen potential" × "breaking beauty" = a still image that contains a visible countdown to collapse

**Emergent Vision:** A 60-second film composed of five 12-second static shots. No camera movement. No music — ambient sound only. Each shot isolates one character in a space where something is subtly wrong (a crack, a tilt, a misalignment). The fourth shot breaks the stillness with a single explosive movement — the only kinetic moment in the film, designed as visual modulation (paralleling Case Study D's concept of modulation as structural disruption).

**Output characteristics:** Complete shot list with specific parameters (aspect ratio 9:16, single light source, saturation -30%, contrast +20%, locked camera, ambient audio only). The protocol produced a concept that *inverts* every convention of the genre (stillness vs. movement, silence vs. music, gaze vs. spectacle) — inversions that emerged from Ghost-level structural analysis rather than a deliberate "let's do the opposite" strategy.

## 7. Controlled Comparisons

To assess the protocols' structural contribution, we conducted controlled comparisons: identical inputs were processed using standard methods (brainstorming, SWOT analysis) and protocol-driven methods (GHOSTY COLLIDER, PRECOG PROTOCOL). Both conditions used the same AI system (Claude, Anthropic) to control for differences in knowledge and language ability. The independent variable is the presence or absence of the protocol structure.

### 7.1 Music Production: Brainstorming vs. GHOSTY COLLIDER

**Input (identical):** Pop group song concept, theme "hiding affection," Jersey Club / UK Garage reference.

| Dimension | Brainstorming (Control) | GHOSTY COLLIDER (Treatment) |
|-----------|------------------------|----------------------------|
| Concept | "Secret crush expressed through dance-pop" | "Concealment as masochistic pleasure — armor that reveals" |
| Key selection rationale | Convention ("G minor sounds emotional") | Structural ("F# minor — tonal isolation matching thematic inwardness") |
| Modulation purpose | Climactic lift (genre standard) | Narrative surrender ("the moment the armor fails") |
| Lyric design unit | Semantic (word meaning) | Phonetic (vowel openness = emotional exposure) |
| Vocal direction | Not specified | 9 sections defined, including "voice permitted to crack" |
| Parameters defined | 4 (key, BPM, structure, lyric theme) | 12 (+ VA coordinates, silence design, vowel mapping, modulation meaning, breakdown philosophy) |
| Quality score | 64/80 (v4-equivalent) | 75/80 (+17.2%) |

**Key finding:** The brainstorming output was commercially viable but structurally indistinguishable from existing genre conventions. GHOSTY COLLIDER produced outputs that were different in *kind*, not merely in *degree* — the modulation from "climactic lift" to "narrative surrender" is not a refinement of the standard approach but a reconceptualization that emerged from Ghost-level analysis.

### 7.2 Short-Form Video: Brainstorming vs. GHOSTY COLLIDER

**Input (identical):** 60-second social media video, 5 characters, goal of maximizing view completion rate.

| Dimension | Brainstorming (Control) | GHOSTY COLLIDER (Treatment) |
|-----------|------------------------|----------------------------|
| Hook strategy | High-energy opening movement | Static gaze (silence as seizure) |
| Lighting | Multi-source, colorful | Single source, shadow-dominant |
| Audio | Background music track | No music — ambient sound only |
| Camera | Dynamic (handheld + crane) | Completely fixed |
| Character utilization | Group formation shots | One character per shot, individual structural analysis |
| Structural principle | "More energy = more engagement" | "Stillness as tension = inescapable engagement" |

**Key finding:** Every major creative decision was inverted. Critically, these inversions were *not* produced by a "do the opposite" instruction — they emerged organically from Ghost Extraction. "Attention is structurally violent" (Ghost of Fragment 3) naturally leads to "stillness as seizure" rather than "movement as attraction." The protocol's de-labeling step prevented the default genre frame from biasing the output.

### 7.3 Trend Forecasting: SWOT Analysis vs. PRECOG PROTOCOL

**Input (identical):** AI agent market assessment, 2026-2028 horizon, publicly available data.

| Dimension | SWOT (Control) | PRECOG PROTOCOL (Treatment) |
|-----------|---------------|----------------------------|
| Temporal structure | None (static snapshot) | 4-category action timeline (Now/Soon/Watch/Kill) |
| Bias detection | None (implicit assumptions) | Systematic (Contrarian View with probability estimates) |
| Signal classification | S/W/O/T quadrants | Strong/Emerging/Weak + confidence tags |
| Timing judgment | Absent | 4-axis grid (market/competitive/technical/regulatory) |
| Action specificity | "Enter the market" (vague) | Actions with trigger conditions and kill criteria |
| Contrarian analysis | Not structurally required | 3 scenarios quantified (25-60% probability ranges) |
| Cross-axis disagreement | Not possible | Detected (market phase = cautious, competitive = go) |

**Key finding:** The SWOT analysis produced a correct but static assessment. PRECOG PROTOCOL's primary advantage was *temporal structure* — it transformed "the situation" into "when to act, contingent on what." The Timing Grid revealed that different axes recommended different actions simultaneously, a nuance invisible to the static SWOT framework. The Contrarian View step surfaced the "agents create new jobs rather than eliminating them" hypothesis — a scenario that did not appear in the SWOT analysis because SWOT lacks a structural mechanism for challenging its own conclusions.

### 7.4 Summary of Controlled Comparisons

| Metric | Control (Standard Methods) | Treatment (Protocols) |
|--------|---------------------------|----------------------|
| Output correctness | ✅ Accurate | ✅ Accurate |
| Output comprehensiveness | ✅ Broad coverage | 🟡 Focused (by design) |
| Structural novelty | ❌ Converges to genre/framework conventions | ✅ Produces qualitatively distinct directions |
| Parameter specificity | 4-6 parameters | 12+ parameters (+200%) |
| Temporal reasoning | ❌ Static | ✅ Dynamic (timing + triggers) |
| Bias detection | ❌ Not built in | ✅ Structural (Contrarian View) |
| Process reproducibility | ❌ Participant-dependent | ✅ Protocol-documented |
| Anti-pattern awareness | ❌ None | ✅ Explicit failure modes |

The controlled comparisons suggest that the protocols' primary contribution is not producing *better* outputs in a conventional sense, but producing *structurally different* outputs — directions that standard methods do not reach because they lack the de-labeling (GHOSTY) and multi-axis temporal reasoning (PRECOG) steps.

## 8. Discussion

### 8.1 Contributions

This work contributes to the literature on creativity support tools (Shneiderman, 2007; Frich et al., 2019) and strategic foresight practice. Specifically:

1. **Theory-to-protocol translation.** We demonstrate that established descriptive theories can be compressed into executable, step-by-step protocols without losing their generative power. The five case studies across distinct domains (financial analysis, business strategy, technology forecasting, music production, video production) suggest domain-generality.

2. **Ghost Extraction as a novel technique.** While de-labeling has been discussed in creativity literature (de Bono's "PO" provocation; Hatchuel & Weil's CK-theory concept expansion), we formalize it into a repeatable procedure with explicit quality criteria and a reversibility test. The controlled comparisons show that Ghost Extraction is the primary mechanism producing structural novelty in outputs.

3. **Multi-axis Timing Grid.** Existing foresight frameworks evaluate individual dimensions (market maturity, competitive position) but none we are aware of formally combines multiple timing axes into a single judgment grid with explicit cross-axis disagreement detection.

4. **Explicit anti-patterns.** Both protocols include documented failure modes with remedies, an uncommon feature in methodology papers that typically present only the positive path.

5. **Controlled evidence of structural differentiation.** The comparisons against brainstorming and SWOT analysis provide initial evidence that protocol-driven outputs differ from standard-method outputs in kind, not merely in degree.

### 8.2 Limitations

1. **Single-operator evaluation.** All case studies and controlled comparisons were executed by a single practitioner with AI assistance. Multi-user evaluation across diverse skill levels and domains would strengthen generalizability claims.

2. **Quality metric subjectivity.** The 1-5 scoring dimensions (Novelty, Feasibility, Resonance, Timing) and the production quality score (e.g., 75/80) rely on assessment criteria defined by the protocol author. Independent inter-rater reliability studies are needed.

3. **Fragment quality dependency.** GHOSTY COLLIDER's output quality depends heavily on fragment diversity and Ghost Extraction depth. We provide quality criteria but acknowledge they require practiced judgment.

4. **AI-assistance confound.** While the protocols are designed for human-only use, the case studies were conducted with AI assistance (Claude, Anthropic). The controlled comparisons hold AI constant between conditions, but the protocols' effectiveness without AI assistance has not been separately evaluated.

5. **Absence of longitudinal downstream validation.** The case studies demonstrate protocol outputs but do not track whether those outputs led to successful real-world implementations. Longitudinal studies tracking vision-to-implementation would provide stronger evidence of practical value.

### 8.3 Future Work

1. **Multi-user studies.** Conduct controlled experiments with practitioners across domains and skill levels, comparing protocol-assisted ideation against unstructured brainstorming and existing methods, with blind evaluation of outputs by domain experts.

2. **Automated quality scoring.** Develop computational proxies for the quality dimensions using semantic similarity metrics, patent database novelty search, and market data cross-referencing.

3. **Longitudinal tracking.** Evaluate PRECOG's prediction accuracy over 12+ months across multiple domains to quantify the Prediction Feedback Loop's value. Track GHOSTY COLLIDER visions through to implementation outcomes.

4. **Domain-specific adaptations.** While designed as domain-general protocols, investigation of domain-specific optimizations (e.g., Ghost Extraction heuristics for biotech vs. digital media) could improve output quality.

5. **Human-only evaluation.** Test the protocols in a paper-and-pen setting without AI assistance to establish the baseline effectiveness of the protocol structure itself, independent of AI capabilities.

## 9. Conclusion

We have presented GHOSTY COLLIDER and PRECOG PROTOCOL as executable bridges between descriptive creativity/foresight theories and prescriptive practice. By formalizing the cognitive operations identified by Koestler, de Bono, Finke et al., Hatchuel & Weil, Ansoff, and Wack into step-by-step protocols with explicit quality criteria and failure modes, we aim to make creative emergence and strategic foresight accessible, repeatable, and improvable.

The five case studies demonstrate domain generality across financial analysis, business strategy, technology forecasting, music production, and video production. The controlled comparisons provide initial evidence that the protocols produce structurally novel outputs — not merely better versions of conventional ideas, but qualitatively different directions that standard methods do not reach.

The protocols are released as open-access documents at https://github.com/GhostyAI-HA/ghosty-collider under CC BY-NC 4.0, and we welcome contributions — particularly new case studies from diverse domains and multi-user evaluations that test the protocols' generalizability beyond their authors.
