## Experiment 1: Urban Agriculture (agriculture × architecture × social design)

### Step 1: Fragment Harvest
1. Vertical farming in converted parking garages — 40% lower energy costs than purpose-built facilities
2. "Third place" theory (Oldenburg, 1989) — community spaces that are neither home nor work
3. Food desert mapping data — 23.5M Americans live >1 mile from a supermarket
4. Japanese 道の駅 (michi-no-eki / roadside stations) — hybrid rest stop + local produce market model

### Step 2: Ghost Extraction
- F1 → "Repurposing a structure designed for one form of storage (vehicles) into another (biological growth) — parasitic infrastructure that feeds on the host's abandonment"
- F2 → "A spatial category defined by what it is NOT — the human need for a container that belongs to no established function"
- F3 → "Geographic exclusion expressed as nutritional deprivation — distance as a mechanism of harm"
- F4 → "A waypoint that converts transit into transaction — capturing the energy of movement to sustain a local system"

**Reversibility Test:**
- F1: Negation → "A structure that cannot be repurposed" → reveals rigidity as a design failure (non-trivial ✅)
- F2: Negation → "All spaces belong to an established function" → reveals the tyranny of categorization (non-trivial ✅)
- F3: Negation → "Proximity guarantees nutrition" → reveals that physical nearness ≠ access (non-trivial ✅)
- F4: Negation → "Transit that passes without transaction" → reveals wasted kinetic opportunity (non-trivial ✅)

### Step 3: Collision Matrix
| | F1 | F2 | F3 | F4 |
|---|---|---|---|---|
| F1 | — | 🤔 | ⚡ | 🤔 |
| F2 | — | — | ⚡ | 🤔 |
| F3 | — | — | — | ⚡ |
| F4 | — | — | — | — |

- F1 × F3: ⚡ Electric — "parasitic infrastructure" × "geographic exclusion as harm" = abandoned structures in food deserts are simultaneously the problem (urban decay) and the solution (repurposable space)
- F2 × F3: ⚡ Electric — "spaces defined by negation" × "distance as harm" = the food desert IS the third place — the absence itself creates community around the act of acquiring food
- F3 × F4: ⚡ Electric — "distance as harm" × "transit as transaction" = converting the commute THROUGH a food desert into the food acquisition event itself

### Step 4: Vision Crystallization

**Vision 1: "Commute Harvest"**
A network of micro-farms installed at transit nodes (bus stops, train stations, parking structures) within food deserts. The commuter's daily movement becomes the distribution mechanism — you harvest your food literally on the way home. The farm exists only because people pass through; the people get food only because the farm intercepts their path.

- Novelty: 4/5 (transit-agriculture integration exists conceptually but not as a commute-harvesting system)
- Feasibility: 3/5 (requires irrigation, permits, but structurally simpler than vertical farms)
- Resonance: 5/5 (solves food desert problem using the very infrastructure that created it)
- Timing: 4/5 (urban agriculture boom + transit infrastructure investment cycle)

**Vision 2: "Absence Market"**
A commercial format where the LACK of a store becomes the store. Mobile/popup units that occupy food desert locations on a rotating schedule, creating a "market of absence" — the scarcity is the brand. Unlike food trucks (which go where demand is), Absence Market goes where supply ISN'T, and the absence is the value proposition.

- Novelty: 3/5 (mobile markets exist; the branding of absence is novel)
- Feasibility: 5/5 (low infrastructure requirement)
- Resonance: 4/5 (turns a negative into an identity)
- Timing: 3/5 (depends on local policy)

### Step 5: Reality Bridge
**Vision 1 MVV:** Single raised-bed installation at one bus stop in a verified food desert, with a "pick your herbs" sign. Cost: <$500. Timeline: 2 weeks.
**Kill Condition:** If vandalism destroys >50% within 30 days, the unguarded model fails.

### Result: ✅ SUCCESS
- 3 Electric collisions from 6 pairwise combinations (50% hit rate)
- 2 Visions crystallized, both scoring ≥3 on all dimensions
- Total execution time: ~15 minutes

## Experiment 2: Elderly Care × E-sports (deliberately distant domains)

### Step 1: Fragment Harvest
1. Japan's aging population — 29% over 65, 9M living alone, declining physical mobility
2. E-sports audience demographics shifting — 35+ audience growing 22% YoY
3. The phenomenon of "見守り" (mimamori / watching over) — ambient monitoring of elderly through indirect signals
4. Speedrunning culture — completing games in minimum time, creating meta-games out of optimization

### Step 2: Ghost Extraction
- F1 → "A demographic mass whose defining characteristic is the progressive loss of agency — the body as a machine entering its reliability decay phase"
- F2 → "A performance spectacle migrating from youth-coded spaces into older demographics — competition becoming age-agnostic when the physical body is removed from the equation"
- F3 → "Care expressed as non-intrusive observation — the paradox of closeness through distance, love expressed as surveillance"
- F4 → "The game within the game — creating meaning by imposing constraints that the original system never intended"

**Reversibility Test:**
- F1: "Agency increasing with age" → reveals ageism in the assumption of decline (non-trivial ✅)
- F2: "Competition requiring physical body" → reveals that traditional sports ENFORCE age limits through physicality (non-trivial ✅)
- F3: "Care requiring proximity" → reveals that in-person care can feel MORE intrusive than remote care (non-trivial ✅)
- F4: "Games played as intended" → reveals that original design intent limits creative possibility (non-trivial ✅)

### Step 3: Collision Matrix
| | F1 | F2 | F3 | F4 |
|---|---|---|---|---|
| F1 | — | ⚡ | 🤔 | 🤔 |
| F2 | — | — | ⚡ | 💤 |
| F3 | — | — | — | ⚡ |
| F4 | — | — | — | — |

- F1 × F2: ⚡ Electric — "corporeal decline" × "competition decoupled from body" = e-sports as the first competitive domain where aging is NOT a disadvantage — cognitive gaming as the great equalizer
- F2 × F3: ⚡ Electric — "spectacle migrating to older demographics" × "care as non-intrusive observation" = WATCHING an elderly person play a game IS mimamori — the game session is both entertainment and health signal
- F3 × F4: ⚡ Electric — "surveillance as love" × "meta-game creation" = the elderly person's daily routine as a speedrun — optimizing their daily activities becomes the game, and the family member watches the "run"

### Step 4: Vision Crystallization

**Vision 1: "Silver Speedrun"**
An application where elderly users' daily routines (cooking, walking, medication) are gamified as "runs" — optimized, timed, scored — while family members observe as "spectators." The game IS the mimamori. The elderly person feels agency (they're competing, optimizing) while the family sees health signals (did they complete the cooking run? How was their walk time?). Competition and care become structurally identical.

- Novelty: 5/5 (nothing like this exists — gamification of elderly routine as a spectator sport/care mechanism)
- Feasibility: 4/5 (wearable + app, existing technology)
- Resonance: 5/5 (solves dignity + monitoring simultaneously)
- Timing: 4/5 (aging population crisis + gamification maturity)

### Step 5: Reality Bridge
**MVV:** A simple daily step-count "competition" between 3 elderly participants, with family members receiving a leaderboard notification. No complex gamification. Cost: Existing smartwatches + LINE bot. Timeline: 1 week.
**Kill Condition:** If participants feel surveilled rather than competitive within 2 weeks.

### Result: ✅ SUCCESS
- 3 Electric collisions from 6 pairwise combinations (50% hit rate)
- 1 Vision crystallized (high scores across all dimensions)
- Note: The high novelty score suggests distant domains produce more surprising visions

## Experiment 3: Tax Accounting × Jazz Music (stress test — maximally different domains)

### Step 1: Fragment Harvest
1. Year-end tax rush behavior — 70% of Japanese individual filings submitted in final 2 weeks of deadline period
2. Jazz improvisation structure — chord changes provide a framework, but the melody is invented in real-time
3. The psychological burden of "unknown unknowns" in tax liability — anxiety from not knowing what you don't know
4. Call-and-response in jazz — one musician's phrase dictates the next musician's response

### Step 2: Ghost Extraction
- F1 → "A population compressed into uniform behavior by a temporal deadline — individuality dissolved by collective urgency"
- F2 → "Freedom expressed WITHIN constraints — the structure enables rather than restricts improvisation"
- F3 → "Fear generated by the gap between known rules and unknown applicability — the terror of a system too complex for the user to comprehend its own behavior toward them"
- F4 → "A conversation where each statement is incomplete until the response arrives — meaning is co-created, not transmitted"

**Reversibility Test:**
- F1: "Deadline that disperses behavior" → early-bird incentives create different collective patterns (non-trivial ✅)
- F2: "Freedom requiring absence of constraints" → reveals the paradox that infinite freedom paralyzes (non-trivial ✅)
- F3: "Fear from known applicability" → knowing the rules doesn't reduce fear if laws are adversarial (non-trivial ✅)
- F4: "Meaning transmitted complete" → reveals that monologue is structurally inferior to dialogue for meaning-making (non-trivial ✅)

### Step 3: Collision Matrix
| | F1 | F2 | F3 | F4 |
|---|---|---|---|---|
| F1 | — | 🤔 | 🤔 | 💤 |
| F2 | — | — | ⚡ | 🤔 |
| F3 | — | — | — | ⚡ |
| F4 | — | — | — | — |

- F2 × F3: ⚡ Electric — "freedom within constraints" × "fear from incomprehensible rules" = the tax system IS a jazz structure — the rules are the chord changes, but nobody teaches the taxpayer how to improvise. The anxiety comes from not knowing the structure enables freedom, not just punishment.
- F3 × F4: ⚡ Electric — "fear of unknown applicability" × "co-created meaning" = tax filing as a conversation, not a submission — the taxpayer's situation "calls" and the tax code "responds," but currently the response is delivered as a monologue (penalty) rather than a dialogue

### Step 4: Vision Crystallization

**Vision 1: "Tax Jazz"**
A tax filing interface designed as call-and-response: the user enters a life event ("I got married," "I bought a house"), and the system "responds" with the relevant implications IN REAL-TIME, building the tax return as an improvised duet. The chord chart (tax code) is invisible — the user only experiences the melody (their life). Fear dissolves because the unknown unknowns are surfaced through dialogue, not through form-filling.

- Novelty: 4/5 (conversational tax exists; the jazz-structural design rationale is novel)
- Feasibility: 4/5 (conversational UI + tax API, technically achievable)
- Resonance: 4/5 (addresses the core anxiety mechanism, not just the UX)
- Timing: 4/5 (LLM-powered conversational interfaces are mature)

### Step 5: Reality Bridge
**MVV:** A chatbot that takes 3 life events and returns the top 3 relevant tax deductions with plain-language explanations. No full filing. Cost: OpenAI API + tax rule DB. Timeline: 2 weeks.
**Kill Condition:** If users still feel anxious after the interaction, the "jazz" metaphor isn't reaching the emotional layer.

### Result: ✅ SUCCESS
- 2 Electric collisions from 6 pairwise combinations (33% hit rate)
- 1 Vision crystallized
- Note: Lower Electric rate than previous experiments, but the conversational tax redesign is genuinely novel

## Experiment 4: Supply Chain Logistics (deliberately homogeneous — testing Failure Case 1)

### Step 1: Fragment Harvest
1. Last-mile delivery costs representing 53% of total shipping cost
2. Warehouse automation reducing picking errors by 99.9%
3. Real-time inventory tracking via IoT sensors
4. Returns logistics (reverse supply chain) growing 25% annually

### Step 2: Ghost Extraction
- F1 → "The final segment consuming the majority of resources — a system where the ending is more expensive than the beginning"
- F2 → "Replacing human judgment with mechanical precision — eliminating variance at the cost of adaptability"
- F3 → "Making the invisible visible — converting physical location into information, collapsing the uncertainty of 'where is it?'"
- F4 → "The backward flow — a system designed for forward motion forced to operate in reverse, at higher cost per unit"

**Reversibility Test:**
- F1: ✅ F2: ✅ F3: ✅ F4: ✅

### Step 3: Collision Matrix
| | F1 | F2 | F3 | F4 |
|---|---|---|---|---|
| F1 | — | 💤 | 💤 | 🤔 |
| F2 | — | — | 💤 | 💤 |
| F3 | — | — | — | 🤔 |
| F4 | — | — | — | — |

- F1 × F2: 💤 Boring — both are logistics optimization, structural similarity too high
- F1 × F3: 💤 Boring — tracking and last-mile are the same conversation
- F2 × F3: 💤 Boring — automation and tracking are complementary but not surprising
- F1 × F4: 🤔 Interesting — last-mile cost × reverse logistics = there's structural overlap but not Electric
- F3 × F4: 🤔 Interesting — visibility × reverse flow = tracking returns, already exists

**⚠️ Anti-Pattern Triggered: Homogeneous Fragments**
All 4 fragments are from supply chain logistics. Zero ⚡ Electric collisions. The Ghosts, while structurally varied, share the same domain substrate — they're all variations on "moving physical objects through space."

### Step 4-5: Skipped (no ⚡ collisions to advance)

### Result: ❌ FAILURE — Homogeneous Fragments
- 0 Electric collisions from 6 pairwise combinations (0% hit rate)
- Anti-pattern correctly detected
- **Lesson confirmed:** Pre-flight diversity check would have caught this before Ghost Extraction

## Experiment 5: Dental Clinic UX × Street Photography (medium distance)

### Step 1: Fragment Harvest
1. Dental anxiety affecting 36% of adults — the sound of the drill as a Pavlovian fear trigger
2. "Decisive moment" in street photography (Cartier-Bresson) — the instant when elements align
3. The waiting room — a space designed for anxiety, where time becomes elastic
4. Street photography ethics — photographing without consent as a contested practice

### Step 2: Ghost Extraction
- F1 → "A sound that has been weaponized by association — an auditory signal that triggers a physical response disproportionate to actual danger"
- F2 → "The compression of all preparation into a single instant — everything before is setup, everything after is too late"
- F3 → "A space where the occupant's primary activity is imagining a future they cannot control — architecture designed to contain anticipatory suffering"
- F4 → "Capturing something true by violating the boundary of permission — authenticity requiring transgression"

**Reversibility Test:** All ✅ pass

### Step 3: Collision Matrix
| | F1 | F2 | F3 | F4 |
|---|---|---|---|---|
| F1 | — | 🤔 | ⚡ | 💤 |
| F2 | — | — | ⚡ | 🤔 |
| F3 | — | — | — | 🤔 |
| F4 | — | — | — | — |

- F1 × F3: ⚡ Electric — "weaponized sound" × "architecture of anticipatory suffering" = the waiting room CREATES the drill anxiety, not the drill itself. The space is the weapon.
- F2 × F3: ⚡ Electric — "decisive moment" × "elastic time in waiting room" = what if the waiting room experience was designed around a single decisive moment rather than diffuse anxiety?

### Step 4: Vision Crystallization

**Vision 1: "The Decisive Clinic"**
A dental clinic redesigned around Cartier-Bresson's decisive moment principle: eliminate the waiting room entirely. Patients arrive at their exact moment — no before, no after. The clinic's architecture, scheduling, and patient journey are designed so that the first thing the patient experiences is the procedure itself, removing all anticipatory suffering. The drill sound is heard once, in context, not previewed through walls and waiting.

- Novelty: 4/5 (appointment-exact clinics exist in theory; the photography-inspired design rationale is novel)
- Feasibility: 3/5 (requires complete scheduling redesign, challenging but not impossible)
- Resonance: 5/5 (directly attacks the root mechanism of dental anxiety)
- Timing: 3/5 (post-COVID scheduling innovation window)

### Step 5: Reality Bridge
**MVV:** One dentist implementing "arrival = treatment" for 5 patients/day — zero waiting room time. Measure anxiety scores before/after.
**Kill Condition:** If no-show rates increase >20% (patients may avoid the "immediate" format).

### Result: ✅ SUCCESS
- 2 Electric collisions from 6 pairwise combinations (33% hit rate)
- 1 Vision crystallized
- Strong resonance score — dental anxiety redesign via photography principles is genuinely unexpected

## Experiment 6: Climate Science × Stand-up Comedy (maximally distant)

### Step 1: Fragment Harvest
1. "Climate grief" — eco-anxiety as a documented psychological phenomenon among climate scientists
2. The comedy "callback" — referencing an earlier joke later in the set for compounded effect
3. IPCC report language — "virtually certain (99%)" vs "likely (66%)" as probability hedging
4. "Punching up vs punching down" — comedy ethics around who is the target of humor

### Step 2: Ghost Extraction
- F1 → "Professional knowledge producing personal suffering — expertise as a pathway to despair when the expert sees what others cannot"
- F2 → "Meaning that accrues through repetition with variation — a signal that gains force each time it reappears in a different context"
- F3 → "Institutional language designed to be precise but perceived as evasive — certainty expressed in a grammar that sounds like uncertainty"
- F4 → "Ethics determined by power differential — the same action is moral or immoral depending on the relative position of actor and target"

**Reversibility Test:** All ✅ pass

### Step 3: Collision Matrix
| | F1 | F2 | F3 | F4 |
|---|---|---|---|---|
| F1 | — | 🤔 | ⚡ | 🤔 |
| F2 | — | — | ⚡ | 💤 |
| F3 | — | — | — | ⚡ |
| F4 | — | — | — | — |

- F1 × F3: ⚡ Electric — "expertise as despair" × "precision perceived as evasion" = climate scientists' despair is CAUSED by the same language system designed to convey their findings — the instrument of communication is the instrument of failure
- F2 × F3: ⚡ Electric — "callback for compounded meaning" × "hedging language" = IPCC probability language functions like a comedy callback — "likely" recurring across reports gains emotional weight through repetition, but the audience (public) doesn't carry the context forward between "sets" (reports)
- F3 × F4: ⚡ Electric — "hedging grammar" × "punching up/down" = IPCC reports "punch down" (speak from institutional authority) but in hedging language (sound like they're punching across) — the power mismatch between speaker position and speech register creates public distrust

### Step 4: Vision Crystallization

**Vision 1: "Climate Set"**
Climate communication restructured as a comedy set: the report is delivered as a narrative with callbacks. Each finding is a "bit" — self-contained but connecting to previous bits. The hedging language is replaced by the comedian's toolkit: setup + punchline (finding + implication), callback (previous report finding reappearing in new context), punching up (always targeting the systems, never the audience). The scientist's despair is channeled through comedy's structural permission to speak truth.

- Novelty: 4/5 (science communication through comedy exists; structural design from comedy theory is novel)
- Feasibility: 4/5 (format change, no technology required)
- Resonance: 5/5 (addresses both the communication failure AND the scientist's emotional burden)
- Timing: 4/5 (climate communication crisis is acute)

### Step 5: Reality Bridge
**MVV:** One climate scientist presenting a 10-minute summary of IPCC findings using callback structure. Film it. Measure comprehension and retention vs. standard presentation.
**Kill Condition:** If audience perceives it as trivializing the issue.

### Result: ✅ SUCCESS
- 3 Electric collisions from 6 pairwise combinations (50% hit rate)
- 1 Vision crystallized with high scores
- The comedy-to-climate communication design is a genuine structural innovation

## Experiment 7: Corporate HR × Fermentation Science (random pairing)

### Step 1: Fragment Harvest
1. "Quiet quitting" — employees doing minimum requirements, disengaged but not departing
2. Koji (麹) fermentation — enzymes breaking down complex molecules into simpler, more flavorful compounds
3. Annual performance reviews — 95% of managers dissatisfied with the process (Deloitte 2015)
4. The concept of "umami" — a flavor category that was culturally invisible until scientifically named

### Step 2: Ghost Extraction
- F1 → "A system where the occupant is present but the essential ingredient (commitment) has evaporated — the container is full but the content is inert"
- F2 → "Controlled decomposition producing something superior to the original — destruction as a required precursor to quality"
- F3 → "A ritual whose participants unanimously acknowledge its dysfunction yet continue performing it — the ceremony outliving its purpose"
- F4 → "A real phenomenon that could not be discussed until vocabulary was invented for it — namelessness as a barrier to existence"

**Reversibility Test:** All ✅ pass

### Step 3: Collision Matrix
| | F1 | F2 | F3 | F4 |
|---|---|---|---|---|
| F1 | — | ⚡ | 🤔 | ⚡ |
| F2 | — | — | 🤔 | 🤔 |
| F3 | — | — | — | ⚡ |
| F4 | — | — | — | — |

- F1 × F2: ⚡ Electric — "inert presence" × "controlled decomposition" = what if quiet quitting is FERMENTATION, not decay? The disengagement is a breakdown phase that, under the right conditions, produces a more complex employee — one who has shed company mythology and operates on personal values
- F1 × F4: ⚡ Electric — "commitment evaporated" × "nameless phenomenon" = quiet quitting became epidemic only AFTER it was named — the naming created the category, which created the permission
- F3 × F4: ⚡ Electric — "ceremony outliving purpose" × "namelessness as barrier" = performance reviews persist because the REPLACEMENT has not been named yet — the dysfunction continues until someone names the successor format

### Step 4: Vision Crystallization

**Vision 1: "Corporate Koji"**
A management philosophy that reframes quiet quitting as the fermentation phase: employees are breaking down the sugars (corporate myths, manufactured enthusiasm) and producing umami (authentic engagement, values-aligned work). Management's role shifts from "re-engagement" to "creating fermentation conditions" — temperature (autonomy), time (patience), starter culture (one genuinely engaged peer). The performance review is replaced by a "tasting" — periodic check on what flavor is developing, not whether the original ingredient is preserved.

- Novelty: 5/5 (this framework does not exist)
- Feasibility: 3/5 (conceptual shift, hard to operationalize directly)
- Resonance: 5/5 (reframes a negative into a natural process)
- Timing: 5/5 (quiet quitting is the dominant HR narrative)

### Step 5: Reality Bridge
**MVV:** One team manager reframing 3 "quiet quitting" direct reports as "fermenting" — changing check-in questions from "what are you working on?" to "what are you thinking about?" for 1 month. Measure whether output quality changes.
**Kill Condition:** If "fermentation" framing is perceived as patronizing by the employees themselves.

### Result: ✅ SUCCESS
- 3 Electric collisions from 6 pairwise combinations (50% hit rate)
- 1 Vision crystallized with exceptional novelty score
- "Corporate Koji" is the strongest single vision across all experiments

## Experiment 8: Cybersecurity × Traditional Japanese Tea Ceremony (max distance)

### Step 1: Fragment Harvest
1. Zero Trust architecture — "never trust, always verify" replacing perimeter-based security
2. 一期一会 (ichigo ichie) — each tea ceremony encounter is unique and unrepeatable
3. Phishing attacks exploiting social trust — 91% of cyberattacks begin with a phishing email
4. 侘び寂び (wabi-sabi) — beauty in imperfection and transience

### Step 2: Ghost Extraction
- F1 → "A paradigm shift from assumed safety (inside = trusted) to assumed hostility (everything is suspect) — inverting the default from trust to suspicion"
- F2 → "Treating each moment as unrepeatable — the deliberate refusal to routinize experience, forcing presence through acknowledged transience"
- F3 → "Weaponized trust — attacking the very mechanism (social bonds) that makes cooperation possible"
- F4 → "Finding value in what is broken, incomplete, or decaying — an aesthetic that inverts the hierarchy of perfection over imperfection"

**Reversibility Test:** All ✅ pass

### Step 3: Collision Matrix
| | F1 | F2 | F3 | F4 |
|---|---|---|---|---|
| F1 | — | ⚡ | 🤔 | 🤔 |
| F2 | — | — | ⚡ | 💤 |
| F3 | — | — | — | ⚡ |
| F4 | — | — | — | — |

- F1 × F2: ⚡ Electric — "assumed hostility" × "unrepeatable encounters" = Zero Trust treats every access as ichigo ichie — each authentication IS unique and unrepeatable. Currently this is a burden; what if it were reframed as a mindfulness practice?
- F2 × F3: ⚡ Electric — "unrepeatable moments" × "weaponized trust" = phishing works because we ROUTINIZE trust — the email looks like all the others. Ichigo ichie's insistence on uniqueness would make each email encounter deserving of fresh attention
- F3 × F4: ⚡ Electric — "weaponized trust" × "beauty in imperfection" = security systems hide their vulnerabilities (pursuing perfection); wabi-sabi suggests that VISIBLE imperfection is more trustworthy than claimed perfection

### Step 4: Vision Crystallization

**Vision 1: "Wabi-Sabi Security"**
A cybersecurity design philosophy that embraces visible imperfection: instead of hiding system vulnerabilities, deliberately surface them to users. Systems that show their patches, expose their known weaknesses, and display their breach history — like the gold-filled cracks of kintsugi. Trust is built not through claims of invulnerability but through transparent acknowledgment of repaired damage. The security dashboard looks like a tea bowl — beautiful BECAUSE of its repairs.

- Novelty: 5/5 (directly opposes the entire industry's approach to vulnerability communication)
- Feasibility: 3/5 (cultural shift required; technically simple)
- Resonance: 5/5 (addresses trust crisis in cybersecurity at a fundamental level)
- Timing: 4/5 (post-breach transparency regulations + zero trust adoption)

### Step 5: Reality Bridge
**MVV:** One internal security dashboard that displays "patches applied this month" and "known residual risks" in a kintsugi-inspired visual format. Measure employee security behavior change vs. traditional "all systems green" dashboard.
**Kill Condition:** If vulnerability display increases attacker interest (opposite of intended effect).

### Result: ✅ SUCCESS
- 3 Electric collisions from 6 pairwise combinations (50% hit rate)
- 1 Vision crystallized
- "Wabi-Sabi Security" directly challenges industry orthodoxy — a strong indicator of genuine structural novelty

| 2 | Elderly Care × E-sports | 4 | 3 | 50% | 1 | ✅ Success |
| 3 | Tax Accounting × Jazz | 4 | 2 | 33% | 1 | ✅ Success |
| 4 | Supply Chain (homogeneous) | 4 | 0 | 0% | 0 | ❌ Failure |

| 7 | Corporate HR × Fermentation | 4 | 3 | 50% | 1 | ✅ Success |
| 8 | Cybersecurity × Tea Ceremony | 4 | 3 | 50% | 1 | ✅ Success |

### Aggregate Metrics
- **Success rate: 7/8 (87.5%)**
- **Failure rate: 1/8 (12.5%)**
- **Failure cause: 100% Homogeneous Fragments (confirmed anti-pattern)**
- **Mean Electric rate (successful experiments): 41.9% of pairwise combinations**
- **Mean Visions per successful experiment: 1.14**
- **Total Visions crystallized: 9 (across 7 successful experiments)**
- **Total ⚡ Electric collisions: 19 (across 48 total pairwise combinations = 39.6%)**

### Failure Analysis
- The ONLY failure occurred when all fragments came from the same domain (supply chain logistics)
- All experiments with cross-domain fragments produced at least 2 ⚡ Electric collisions
- The pre-flight diversity check (requiring at least 2 distinct domains in fragments) would have prevented 100% of observed failures
- No instances of "Shallow Ghosting" or "Electric Inflation" were observed in this batch, though this may reflect operator experience rather than protocol robustness

### Quality Observations
- Domain distance correlates with vision novelty: maximally distant domains (Exp 2, 6, 7, 8) produced the highest novelty scores
- The reversibility test caught no Ghosts in this batch — all passed on first attempt, suggesting operator familiarity with the extraction technique
- Vision feasibility scores were inversely correlated with novelty scores (r ≈ -0.6), consistent with the theory that more novel visions require more departure from existing infrastructure
