## Abstract

Creativity and strategic foresight have been extensively studied through descriptive theories — Koestler's bisociation (1964), de Bono's lateral thinking (1967), and Ansoff's weak signals (1975) explain *why* creative and strategic insights occur, but offer limited guidance on *how to produce them on demand*. This paper presents two executable protocols that bridge this theory-practice gap: **GHOSTY COLLIDER**, a 5-step protocol for cross-domain creative emergence through structural de-labeling and collision, and **PRECOG PROTOCOL**, a 5-step protocol for signal-based strategic foresight with multi-axis timing judgment. We formalize established theories into repeatable, step-by-step procedures with explicit quality criteria, anti-pattern detection, and measurable outputs. We demonstrate both protocols through two case studies — game design innovation and AI market timing analysis — and discuss their integration, where signals from PRECOG become input fragments for GHOSTY COLLIDER, and visions from GHOSTY COLLIDER feed PRECOG's action windows. The protocols are released as open-access documents under CC BY-NC 4.0 at https://github.com/GhostyAI-HA/ghosty-collider.

## 1. Introduction

The gap between creativity theory and creative practice is well-documented. Sawyer (2012) notes that decades of creativity research have produced rich explanatory models but few actionable tools for practitioners. Similarly, in strategic foresight, Rohrbeck et al. (2015) observe that while scanning and scenario methodologies are theoretically mature, their translation into organizational practice remains challenging — requiring multi-week workshops, trained facilitators, and significant resources.

This paper addresses a specific version of this gap: **Can established creativity and foresight theories be compressed into executable, repeatable protocols that produce measurable outputs in a single session?**

We present two protocols designed to answer this question:

1. **GHOSTY COLLIDER** transforms creativity theories (bisociation, lateral thinking, Geneplore model) into a 5-step procedure: Fragment Harvest → Ghost Extraction → Collision Matrix → Vision Crystallization → Reality Bridge. The key innovation is *Ghost Extraction* — a systematic de-labeling process that reduces concepts to their deep structural elements (verbs, forces, transformations) before collision, dramatically increasing the probability of non-obvious cross-domain connections.

2. **PRECOG PROTOCOL** transforms strategic foresight methodologies (horizon scanning, weak signals theory, scenario planning) into a 5-step procedure: Signal Map → Convergence Analysis → Contrarian View → Timing Grid → Action Window. The key innovations are the *multi-axis Timing Grid* (evaluating market phase, competitive position, organizational readiness, and external windows simultaneously) and *Signal History tracking* for longitudinal foresight.

The protocols share a design philosophy: strip away the scaffolding of workshops, facilitators, and multi-day processes, preserving only the core cognitive operations that produce insight. They are designed to be executed by individuals, with or without AI assistance, in a single session.

The remainder of this paper is organized as follows: Section 2 reviews the theoretical foundations. Section 3 presents GHOSTY COLLIDER. Section 4 presents PRECOG PROTOCOL. Section 5 describes their integration. Section 6 demonstrates both protocols through case studies. Section 7 discusses limitations and future directions. Section 8 concludes.

## 2. Related Work

### 2.1 Creativity Theories

**Bisociation Theory.** Koestler (1964) introduced bisociation as the simultaneous perception of an idea in two self-consistent but habitually incompatible "matrices of thought." Unlike association (connecting ideas within a single frame), bisociation requires the collision of separate frames — the "Eureka moment" occurs when a connection is perceived across frames that were previously considered unrelated. GHOSTY COLLIDER operationalizes this through Ghost Extraction (stripping frames) and Collision Matrix (forcing cross-frame intersection).

**Lateral Thinking.** De Bono (1967, 1970) formalized the concept of lateral thinking as a deliberate method for breaking out of dominant patterns. His key insight — that logical, sequential thinking is insufficient for creative leaps because it stays within established patterns — motivates GHOSTY COLLIDER's de-labeling step. By removing the label (the pattern), the thinker is forced into a lateral mode.

**Geneplore Model.** Finke, Ward, and Smith (1992) proposed a two-phase model of creativity: the *generative phase* (producing pre-inventive structures — ambiguous, incomplete mental representations) and the *exploratory phase* (interpreting, refining, and evaluating these structures). GHOSTY COLLIDER maps directly onto this model: Steps 1-3 (Fragment Harvest through Collision Matrix) constitute the generative phase, producing pre-inventive structures through de-labeling and collision; Steps 4-5 (Vision Crystallization through Reality Bridge) constitute the exploratory phase, interpreting emergent patterns and grounding them in reality.

**Existing Creativity Methods.** Several structured methods exist for creative production. Osborn's (1953) brainstorming generates ideas through free association but remains within familiar frames. Eberle's (1996) SCAMPER provides systematic modification operators (Substitute, Combine, Adapt, etc.) but is bounded by the existing form of the object. Altshuller's (1946) TRIZ offers powerful inventive principles for engineering problems but requires domain-specific technical contradictions as input. The Design Thinking framework (IDEO; Brown, 2008) centers the process on user empathy but requires user research as a prerequisite. GHOSTY COLLIDER differs from all of these in its input (raw, heterogeneous fragments from any domain), its process (de-labeling before combination), and its output (a named vision of something that does not yet exist).

### 2.2 Strategic Foresight Methodologies

**Horizon Scanning.** Developed and practiced by organizations including the OECD, UNDP, and the UK Government Office for Science, horizon scanning is the systematic examination of information to identify potential threats, risks, emerging issues, and opportunities (Amanatidou et al., 2012). It provides a structured approach to signal collection but does not prescribe how to synthesize signals into timing judgments.

**Weak Signals Theory.** Ansoff (1975) introduced the concept of weak signals — early, imprecise, ambiguous indicators of impending change that are detectable before they crystallize into clear trends. Hiltunen (2010) extended this work, proposing methods for signal detection and interpretation. PRECOG PROTOCOL's Convergence Analysis step operationalizes weak signal detection by requiring explicit evidence and confidence tagging.

**Scenario Planning.** Originating at Royal Dutch Shell through the work of Pierre Wack (1985a, 1985b), scenario planning constructs multiple plausible future narratives to prepare decision-makers for uncertainty. Van der Heijden (1996) formalized the methodology into a systematic process. PRECOG PROTOCOL incorporates this spirit through its Contrarian View step, which explicitly challenges the dominant narrative and identifies preconditions for thesis validity.

**Existing Strategic Frameworks.** Practitioners commonly use SWOT analysis (Learned et al., 1965), PESTEL scanning (Aguilar, 1967), Porter's Five Forces (Porter, 1979), and the BCG Matrix (Henderson, 1970) for strategic analysis. While valuable, these frameworks share three limitations that PRECOG PROTOCOL addresses: (1) they lack built-in bias detection mechanisms, (2) they do not produce explicit timing judgments, and (3) they do not support longitudinal signal tracking across sessions.

### 2.3 The Theory-Practice Gap

The common thread across these literatures is a gap between explanation and execution. Creativity theories tell us *what happens* during creative insight; foresight methodologies tell us *what to look for*. Neither tells practitioners *exactly what to do, step by step, with explicit quality criteria and failure modes*. This paper's contribution is precisely this translation: from theory (descriptive) to protocol (prescriptive).

## 3. GHOSTY COLLIDER: A Protocol for Creative Emergence

### 3.1 Overview

GHOSTY COLLIDER is a 5-step protocol for generating cross-domain creative visions from heterogeneous input fragments. Its tagline captures its essence: *"You don't think your way to a vision. You wait for it to appear."*

The protocol's core operation — Ghost Extraction — is a systematic de-labeling procedure that reduces concepts to their deep structural elements: verbs, forces, and transformations. By removing the familiar label, the thinker (human or AI agent) is forced to perceive the concept's structural essence, enabling non-obvious connections with structurally similar or opposing concepts from unrelated domains.

### 3.2 Procedure

**Step 1: Fragment Harvest.** Collect 3-5 fragments from diverse domains. Fragments may include quantitative data, qualitative observations, aesthetic impressions, gut feelings, absent patterns ("Why doesn't this exist?"), personal experiences, or constraints. The key requirement is diversity — homogeneous fragments (all from the same domain) reduce the probability of non-obvious collisions.

**Step 2: Ghost Extraction (De-labeling).** For each fragment, strip its label and describe its deep structure using only structural language — no proper nouns, no industry jargon. The output (called a "Ghost") should read as a transformation: "X converts Y into Z" or "A mechanism that produces B through C." Quality criteria include: (a) uses verbs rather than nouns, (b) includes the emotional dimension of the experience, (c) is comprehensible to someone from a completely different domain, and (d) passes the reversibility test (negating the Ghost reveals something non-trivial).

**Step 3: Collision Matrix.** Score pairwise combinations of Ghosts for structural resonance on a three-point scale: 💤 Boring (surface AND structural similarity — discard), 🤔 Interesting (structural overlap exists — hold), ⚡ Electric (surfaces are unrelated BUT deep structures resonate or clash — advance). Only Electric collisions proceed.

**Step 4: Vision Crystallization.** For each Electric collision, articulate what emerges — something that existed in neither fragment alone. Each vision requires: a name, a one-line description, an emotional characterization, a cinematic image, and a "Why Now?" justification. Visions are rated on four dimensions (Novelty, Feasibility, Resonance, Timing) on a 1-5 scale; all dimensions must score ≥ 3 to advance.

**Step 5: Reality Bridge.** Ground the vision in actionable terms: Minimum Viable Vision (smallest implementation that reproduces the core experience), existing capabilities that approximate the vision, kill conditions (what would invalidate this vision), and a first step executable within 24 hours.

### 3.3 Quality Criteria and Anti-Patterns

The protocol includes explicit failure modes:

| Anti-Pattern | Description | Remedy |
|-------------|-------------|--------|
| Shallow Ghosting | Ghost is a synonym of the label | Ask "Why does this *feel* the way it does?" |
| Electric Inflation | Every collision scored ⚡ | If explainable in 2 seconds, it's 🤔 at best |
| Vision Without Grounding | Beautiful concept, no Reality Bridge | Never skip Step 5 |
| Homogeneous Fragments | All fragments from one domain | Require at least one external-domain fragment |
| Forced Collision | Connecting fragments without genuine resonance | Permitted to report "No ⚡ collisions found" |

## 4. PRECOG PROTOCOL: A Protocol for Strategic Foresight

### 4.1 Overview

PRECOG PROTOCOL is a 5-step protocol for signal-based strategic foresight with explicit timing judgment. It compresses the core logic of horizon scanning, weak signals theory, and scenario planning into a single-session executable format, while adding two innovations: multi-axis timing judgment and longitudinal signal tracking.

### 4.2 Procedure

**Step 1: Signal Map.** Collect 3-5 observable signals related to a target theme. Each signal requires: a one-line description, specific evidence with sources, a direction indicator (↑ Accelerating / → Stable / ↓ Decelerating), and a mandatory confidence tag ([Verified] = primary source accessible; [Reported] = multi-source coverage; [Speculative] = inference or rumor). Signal sources include numeric changes, behavioral changes, narrative changes, and absent signals.

**Step 2: Convergence Analysis.** Identify where multiple signals intersect and reverse-engineer the underlying structural shift. For each convergence point: state the structural hypothesis in one sentence, articulate the causal logic connecting the signals, and assign confidence (High/Medium/Low) with rationale.

**Step 3: Contrarian View.** For the most obvious conclusion, systematically examine why it might be wrong. Requirements include: at least one reason the dominant view may be overestimated, a historical analogy where a similar setup led to a different outcome, explicit preconditions ("This hypothesis is valid only if A and B hold"), and a collapse trigger (which precondition failure invalidates the thesis).

**Step 4: Timing Grid.** Evaluate timing across four independent axes:

- *Market Phase Axis*: Position on the hype cycle (Emergence → Acceleration → Peak → Correction → Plateau)
- *Competitive Timing Axis*: Strategic position (First Mover → Fast Follower → Fortifier → Too Late)
- *Organizational Readiness Axis*: Capability assessment (Not Ready → Partially Ready → Ready)
- *External Window Axis*: Regulatory, capital, seasonal, and technology maturity factors

Each axis produces an independent judgment; the overall timing judgment synthesizes all four.

**Step 5: Action Window.** Specify concrete actions across three time horizons: Now (start immediately, low-cost), Soon (invest when specific conditions are met), and Watch (do not move, but trigger on specific signals). Each action requires: responsible party, specific action, execution trigger, and estimated cost.

### 4.3 Signal History and Feedback Loop

When analyzing the same theme across multiple sessions, PRECOG PROTOCOL supports longitudinal tracking through delta detection: each signal is compared against previous analyses and classified as Strengthened, Stable, Weakened, New, or Dead. New and Dead signals receive priority in Convergence Analysis as the strongest evidence of structural change.

A Prediction Feedback Loop tracks past prediction accuracy (Hit/Miss/Partial), timing accuracy, and contrarian value to improve future analyses.

## 5. Integration: GHOSTY COLLIDER × PRECOG PROTOCOL

While each protocol functions independently, they exhibit strong complementarity:

**PRECOG → GHOSTY.** Signals and convergence points from PRECOG analysis serve as high-quality fragments for GHOSTY COLLIDER. Because these signals have already been evidence-tagged and structurally analyzed, they produce richer Ghosts during extraction.

**GHOSTY → PRECOG.** Visions crystallized by GHOSTY COLLIDER feed directly into PRECOG's Action Window. A vision's "Why Now?" justification maps naturally to the Timing Grid, and its Reality Bridge (MVV, Kill Conditions) provides the specificity required by PRECOG's action specifications.

This bidirectional integration creates a cycle: signals inform creative exploration, and creative visions inform strategic timing — a loop that neither protocol achieves alone.

## 6. Case Studies

### 6.1 Case Study 1: Game Design Innovation (GHOSTY COLLIDER)

**Fragments:**
1. F2P game metrics: DAU declining slowly, but return rate is unusually high
2. Solo camping boom in Japan — people paying for structured solitude
3. AI agents evolving from tools to autonomous collaborators

**Ghost Extraction:**
- Ghost 1: "Not desertion but pilgrimage — periodic departure from a place that still holds meaning"
- Ghost 2: "Paying for structured solitude that restores agency and presence"
- Ghost 3: "A non-human entity graduating from servant to companion"

**Collision Results:**
- Fragment 1 × 2: ⚡ Electric — both involve voluntary departure that paradoxically strengthens connection
- Fragment 2 × 3: ⚡ Electric — solo camping and AI companionship are both mechanisms for reclaiming personal agency

**Emergent Vision: "The Pilgrimage Loop"**

*"A game designed to be left — where leaving is part of the experience. An AI companion tends to your world during absence, and upon return, shows you what grew while you were away."*

Quality scores: Novelty 5/5 (no existing game designs departure as a feature), Feasibility 4/5 (AI agents can generate contextual events today), Resonance 4/5 (reverses FOMO into anticipation), Timing 4/5 (AI agent APIs stable enough for autonomous daily actions in 2025-2026).

This case demonstrates Ghost Extraction's power: "DAU declining with high return rate" (a standard metric) became "pilgrimage" (a deep structural insight), which produced a collision with "structured solitude" that would have been invisible at the surface level.

### 6.2 Case Study 2: AI Agent Market Timing (PRECOG PROTOCOL)

**Signals:**
1. AI agent platforms proliferating (↑, [Verified])
2. Enterprise AI agent adoption at 65% piloting (↑, [Reported])
3. Framework fatigue among developers (→, [Speculative])
4. Individual developer tooling underinvested (↑, [Reported])
5. "AI agent" at peak media hype (↑, [Verified])

**Convergence:** Signal 3 + Signal 4: "Framework fatigue plus individual tooling gap creates opportunity for opinionated personal frameworks." Signal 2 + Signal 5: "Enterprise surge at hype peak historically precedes correction in 6-12 months."

**Contrarian View:** The "hype peak" narrative may be wrong. Unlike blockchain/metaverse cycles, AI agents deliver measurable productivity gains (55% faster coding with Copilot). Enterprise adoption at 65% is unusually high for hype — the cloud computing parallel (2010-2012) suggests this may be genuine infrastructure shift rather than bubble.

**Timing Grid:** Market Phase: Acceleration (Go-leaning); Competitive: First Mover for personal framework niche (Go); Readiness: Ready (Go); External Window: Regulation easing (Go). **Overall: Go with differentiation.**

This case demonstrates the value of the multi-axis Timing Grid: while the Market Phase axis alone would suggest caution (approaching peak), combining all four axes produced a clear "Go" for a differentiated niche.

## 7. Discussion

### 7.1 Contributions

This work contributes to the literature on creativity support tools (Shneiderman, 2007; Frich et al., 2019) and strategic foresight practice. Specifically:

1. **Theory-to-protocol translation.** We demonstrate that established descriptive theories can be compressed into executable, step-by-step protocols without losing their generative power.

2. **Ghost Extraction as a novel technique.** While de-labeling has been discussed in creativity literature (de Bono's "PO" provocation), we formalize it into a repeatable procedure with explicit quality criteria and a reversibility test.

3. **Multi-axis Timing Grid.** Existing foresight frameworks evaluate individual dimensions (market maturity, competitive position) but none we are aware of formally combines multiple timing axes into a single judgment grid.

4. **Explicit anti-patterns.** Both protocols include documented failure modes with remedies, an uncommon feature in methodology papers that typically present only the positive path.

### 7.2 Limitations

1. **Lack of controlled evaluation.** The case studies demonstrate protocol execution but do not constitute empirical validation. Controlled experiments comparing outputs against baseline methods (brainstorming, SWOT analysis) would strengthen the claims.

2. **Quality metric subjectivity.** The 1-5 scoring dimensions (Novelty, Feasibility, Resonance, Timing) rely on subjective assessment. Inter-rater reliability studies are needed.

3. **Fragment quality dependency.** GHOSTY COLLIDER's output quality depends heavily on fragment diversity and Ghost Extraction depth. We provide quality criteria but acknowledge they require judgment.

4. **AI-assistance dependency.** While the protocols are designed for human-only use, they were developed in the context of AI-augmented knowledge work. Their effectiveness without AI assistance has not been separately evaluated.

### 7.3 Future Work

1. **User studies.** Conduct controlled experiments with practitioners across domains, comparing protocol-assisted ideation against unstructured brainstorming and existing methods.

2. **Automated quality scoring.** Develop computational proxies for the quality dimensions using semantic similarity, patent database novelty search, and market data.

3. **Longitudinal tracking.** Evaluate PRECOG's prediction accuracy over 12+ months across multiple domains to quantify the Prediction Feedback Loop's value.

4. **Domain-specific adaptations.** While designed as domain-general protocols, investigation of domain-specific optimizations (e.g., Ghost Extraction heuristics for biotech vs. digital media) could improve output quality.

## 8. Conclusion

We have presented GHOSTY COLLIDER and PRECOG PROTOCOL as executable bridges between descriptive creativity/foresight theories and prescriptive practice. By formalizing the cognitive operations identified by Koestler, de Bono, Finke et al., Ansoff, and Wack into step-by-step protocols with explicit quality criteria and failure modes, we aim to make creative emergence and strategic foresight accessible, repeatable, and improvable.

The protocols are released as open-access documents at https://github.com/GhostyAI-HA/ghosty-collider under CC BY-NC 4.0, and we welcome contributions — particularly new case studies from diverse domains that test the protocols' generalizability.
