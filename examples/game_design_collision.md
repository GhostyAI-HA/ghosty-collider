# Example: Game Design Collision

> A full GHOSTY COLLIDER walkthrough using F2P game data, solo camping trends, and AI agent evolution.

---

## Fragments

| # | Fragment |
|---|----------|
| 1 | F2P game: DAU declining slowly, but return rate is unusually high |
| 2 | Solo camping is booming in Japan — people pay to be alone in nature |
| 3 | AI agents are evolving from tools to autonomous collaborators |

---

## Ghost Extraction

| # | Fragment | Ghost (Deep Structure) |
|---|----------|----------------------|
| 1 | F2P churn + high return | "Not desertion but pilgrimage — periodic departure from a place that still holds meaning" |
| 2 | Solo camping boom | "Paying for structured solitude that restores agency and presence" |
| 3 | AI agent evolution | "A non-human entity graduating from servant to companion" |

### Quality Check:
- ✅ Ghost 1 uses metaphor ("pilgrimage") that reveals the *feeling* of return behavior
- ✅ Ghost 2 identifies the underlying human need (agency restoration), not just the activity
- ✅ Ghost 3 captures the relational shift, not the technical evolution

## Collision Matrix

| A × B | Score | Resonance |
|-------|-------|-----------|
| 1 × 2 | ⚡ | Both involve **voluntary departure** that paradoxically strengthens connection. Campers leave civilization to appreciate it; players leave a game to return refreshed |
| 1 × 3 | 🤔 | AI as companion could change what "returning to a game" means — but structural resonance is indirect |
| 2 × 3 | ⚡ | Solo camping = restoring agency through solitude. AI companion = restoring agency through delegation. **Both are mechanisms for reclaiming control** |

## 👻 VISION: The Pilgrimage Loop

> "A game that is *designed* to be left — and designs the leaving as part of the experience. An AI companion tends to your world while you're away, and when you return, it shows you what grew in your absence."

**Feel:** Wonder, nostalgia, gentle surprise

**Image:** A player opens the app after 2 weeks away. Their AI companion says, "While you were gone, the garden bloomed. A traveler visited — they left you a letter." The world didn't freeze. It lived.

**Why Now:** AI agents can now autonomously tend to game worlds. Before 2025, NPCs could only run scripted events. Now they can make contextual decisions, making "off-screen life" genuinely surprising.

### Quality Score:

| Dimension | Score | Rationale |
|-----------|-------|-----------|
| Novelty | ⭐⭐⭐⭐⭐ | No game currently designs departure as a feature. Asynchronous events exist, but not AI-driven "world life." |
| Feasibility | ⭐⭐⭐⭐ | AI agents can generate contextual events today. The tech exists; the design philosophy is what's new. |
| Resonance | ⭐⭐⭐⭐ | "I wonder what happened while I was away" is a powerful emotional hook — it reverses FOMO into anticipation. |
| Timing | ⭐⭐⭐⭐ | AI agent APIs just became stable enough for daily autonomous actions (2025-2026). |

## Reality Bridge

📋 **ACTION CARD: The Pilgrimage Loop**

| Field | Value |
|-------|-------|
| **Priority** | Soon |
| **MVV** | A prototype where an AI agent generates one meaningful change per day in a player's world while they're offline. Test with 100 players for 30 days. |
| **First Step** | Define 10 possible "world events" an AI could generate during player absence. Rank by emotional impact. |
| **Owner** | Game design lead |
| **Trigger** | AI agent API becomes stable enough for daily autonomous actions |
| **Kill Condition** | Players don't notice or care about the changes when they return (measured by session length on return day vs. baseline) |

## What Made This Work

1. **Fragment diversity**: Game metrics + cultural trend + technology shift — three completely different domains
2. **Ghost depth**: "Pilgrimage" (Ghost 1) was deeper than "churn" — it revealed the *emotional* truth behind the data
3. **Structural resonance**: The ⚡ connection between "voluntary departure" and "agency restoration" was non-obvious but structurally real
4. **Why Now was concrete**: Specific technology maturity (AI agent APIs in 2025-2026) made this vision timely, not timeless
