# Example: AI Agent Market Timing Analysis

> A full PRECOG PROTOCOL walkthrough analyzing the AI agent market for strategic framework positioning.

---

## Context

**Question:** "Analyze the AI agent market for 2026. When should I position my framework?"

---

## Step 1: Signal Map

| # | Signal | Direction | Tag | Evidence |
|---|--------|-----------|-----|----------|
| 1 | AI agent platforms proliferating | ↑ | [Verified] | Anthropic Claude Code, Google Gemini CLI, OpenAI Agents SDK all launched 2025-2026. GitHub Copilot Agent Mode surpassed 1M monthly actives (Q4 2025 official) |
| 2 | Enterprise AI agent adoption accelerating | ↑ | [Reported] | McKinsey 2025 report: 65% of enterprises piloting AI agents, up from 20% in 2024. Multiple sources, McKinsey report primary |
| 3 | AI agent framework fatigue setting in | → | [Speculative] | LangChain, CrewAI, AutoGen — developers complaining about complexity and boilerplate on HackerNews/Reddit. Anecdotal but consistent |
| 4 | Individual developer AI tooling underinvested | ↑ | [Reported] | Most frameworks target teams/enterprises. Solo developer and small team tooling remains fragmented. Dev survey data from Stack Overflow 2025 |
| 5 | "AI agent" hype peaking in media | ↑ | [Verified] | Google Trends for "AI agent" at all-time high. Gartner placed "AI agents" near Peak of Inflated Expectations in 2025 Hype Cycle |

---

## Step 2: Convergence Analysis

**Convergence 1: "Tool fatigue + individual gap = opportunity for opinionated, personal frameworks"**
- Signals 3 + 4 converge: Developers are drowning in general-purpose agent frameworks while individual productivity tooling is underserved
- Confidence: **High** — consistent signal across multiple developer communities

**Convergence 2: "Hype peak + enterprise surge = correction is 6-12 months away"**
- Signals 2 + 5 converge: Enterprise adoption is surging AT the hype peak, which historically precedes a correction phase
- Confidence: **Medium** — timing uncertain, could be 6-18 months

---

## Step 3: Contrarian View

🔴 **Contrarian: "AI agents are not at hype peak — they're at genuine inflection"**

- **Reason 1:** Unlike blockchain/metaverse hype cycles, AI agents deliver measurable productivity gains (GitHub data: 55% faster coding with Copilot). Real utility slows down the correction.
- **Reason 2:** Enterprise adoption at 65% piloting is unusually high for "hype" — usually hype peaks at 20-30% piloting.
- **Historical parallel:** Cloud computing (2010-2012) — appeared to be "hype" but was actually genuine infrastructure shift. Correction was mild and brief.
- **Preconditions:** This thesis holds IF productivity gains sustain AND cost per token continues declining.
- **Collapse trigger:** If a major AI agent failure causes regulatory backlash (e.g., autonomous agent causes financial loss), correction could be severe.

## Step 4: Timing Grid

| Axis | Current Position | Judgment |
|------|-----------------|----------|
| Market Phase | 📈 Acceleration (possibly approaching 🏔️) | Go, but differentiate |
| Competitive | 🏃 First Mover (for personal/individual framework space) | Go — this niche is unoccupied |
| Org Readiness | 🟢 Ready (framework already built and operational) | Go |
| External Window | AI regulation discussions ongoing but no imminent restrictions [Reported] | Go (window open) |
| → **Overall** | **Go — with differentiation focus.** Position as personal/individual framework, not yet-another-enterprise-agent-platform |

---

## Step 5: Action Window

| Category | Action | WHO | TRIGGER | COST |
|----------|--------|-----|---------|------|
| **Now** | Publish Level 1 GitHub release (framework structure + concept docs) | Framework author | — | 2-3 days effort |
| **Now** | Write 2 positioning articles: "Why personal AI frameworks matter" | Framework author | — | 1 day each |
| **Soon** | Release 5 generic skills as open-source examples | Framework author | After GitHub reaches 50 stars | 1 week effort |
| **Soon** | Apply for tech conferences (CEDEC, AI summits) | Framework author | After first 2 articles get traction | Application fee |
| **Watch** | Monitor for AI agent correction signals | Ongoing | If 3+ enterprise AI agent projects publicly cancelled in same quarter | — |
| **Watch** | Track competitor personal framework releases | Ongoing | If a major player launches personal framework toolkit | — |

## What Made This Work

1. **Signal diversity**: Mix of [Verified], [Reported], and [Speculative] signals — not all one type
2. **Convergence was non-obvious**: "Framework fatigue" + "individual gap" isn't a headline you'd find anywhere — it emerged from connecting signals
3. **Contrarian added real value**: The cloud computing parallel (2010-2012) challenged the "hype peak" narrative with a specific historical case
4. **Timing Grid forced multi-axis thinking**: Market phase was ambiguous (Go-leaning but caution needed), but Competitive axis was clearly "Go" — the niche was unoccupied
5. **Action Window was specific**: "Publish Level 1" and "2 positioning articles" are concrete actions, not vague recommendations
