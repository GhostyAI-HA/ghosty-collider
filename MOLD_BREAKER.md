# 🔨 MOLD BREAKER — Typicality Bias Destruction Protocol

> **"The first three ideas are always the mold. Break it."**

---

## 1. What This Is

MOLD BREAKER is an executable protocol for destroying **Typicality Bias** — the tendency of both humans and AI to converge on safe, conventional, genre-standard outputs.

When you ask for ideas, the first ideas are always the most probable ones. They are the mold — the shape that everything naturally falls into. MOLD BREAKER systematically discards that mold and forces what remains into structurally novel territory.

### When to Use Which Protocol

| Your situation | Protocol | What it does |
|---------------|----------|-------------|
| "I have raw materials and want to see what emerges" | **GHOSTY COLLIDER** | Strips labels → collides deep structures → crystallizes visions |
| "I need to know when to move" | **PRECOG PROTOCOL** | Reads signals → multi-axis timing → action windows |
| **"I have ideas but they're all boring"** | **→ MOLD BREAKER** | **Destroys typicality → forces structural novelty** |

**MOLD BREAKER vs GHOSTY COLLIDER:** MOLD BREAKER sharpens *existing* ideas. GHOSTY COLLIDER creates ideas from *nothing*. They combine naturally — use GHOSTY COLLIDER to generate visions, then MOLD BREAKER to push them past convention.

---

## 2. Theoretical Foundation

MOLD BREAKER formalizes insights from:

- **Typicality Bias in AI-assisted ideation** (Doshi & Hauser, 2024) — LLMs produce ideas that individually score well but collectively converge, reducing aggregate diversity ("flattening effect")
- **Constraint-based creativity** (Stokes, 2005) — Deliberately imposed constraints increase creative output by forcing departure from default solutions
- **Structured analogical transfer** (Gick & Holyoak, 1983; Gentner, 1983) — Forcing connections to distant domains produces structurally novel solutions
- **Lateral thinking provocations** (de Bono, 1967) — Systematic disruption of established thinking patterns

The key insight: **the most probable output of any ideation process — human or AI — is the least interesting.** MOLD BREAKER makes this insight actionable.

## 3. The Protocol (5 Steps)

### 🎯 Step 1: Generate 5 Candidates (Volume First)

Produce 5 candidates quickly. They should be directionally diverse — don't self-censor, don't filter yet.

**Rules:**
- Speed over quality at this stage
- Each candidate should take a different angle
- Mark each candidate with a one-line summary

---

### ❌ Step 2: Reject the First 3 Obvious Ones (Forced Discard)

**This is the core of MOLD BREAKER.** Explicitly discard the 3 most typical candidates.

For each discarded candidate, state the rejection reason in one line:

| Rejection Reason | Example |
|-----------------|---------|
| "Genre standard" | "3-tier pricing with Free/Pro/Enterprise — every SaaS does this" |
| "First association" | "Coffee shop loyalty app — obvious connection, no structural novelty" |
| "Surface-level twist" | "It's X but upside down — cosmetic inversion, not structural" |

**Why 3?** Research on ideation consistently shows that the first ideas in any generation process cluster around high-probability solutions. By discarding 3 of 5, you eliminate the probability peak and force attention to the tails.

---

### ✅ Step 3: Select Top 2 + Hybrid (Keep the Edge)

From the remaining candidates, select the 2 with the **most structural novelty** — not the most "creative-sounding," but the ones whose underlying structure differs most from convention.

For each selected candidate, provide:
- **Target:** Who this is for
- **Edge:** What makes it structurally different
- **Risk:** What could go wrong

**Hybrid check:** Can elements from the two selected candidates be recombined into a third option? If yes, propose it. If no, move on.

---

### 🔀 Step 4: Provide 2 Orthogonal Frames (Shift the Axis)

Present 2 perspectives that are **perpendicular** to the selected candidates:

| Frame Type | Example |
|-----------|---------|
| Market vs. Narrative | "What if we designed for story rather than conversion?" |
| Short-term vs. Long-term | "What if we optimized for 5-year retention rather than Day 1 activation?" |
| Intrinsic vs. Social | "What if the value was entirely private rather than shareable?" |
| Additive vs. Subtractive | "What if we removed features instead of adding them?" |

These frames are not solutions — they are **lenses**. Apply each lens to the selected candidates and note if anything new appears.

---

### 🔪 Step 5: Add a Killer Constraint (Force the Final Edge)

Add one constraint that forces maximum departure from convention:

| Constraint Type | Example |
|----------------|---------|
| **Prohibition** | "You cannot use any words from the competitor's marketing" |
| **Inversion** | "The user must complete 3 tasks before seeing the product" |
| **Resource limit** | "The entire solution must fit in a single SMS" |
| **Perspective lock** | "Design as if the user has never seen a computer" |
| **Time compression** | "The entire experience must complete in 30 seconds" |

The Killer Constraint is not arbitrary — it should directly attack the typicality that remains in the selected candidates.

---

## 4. Typicality Assessment Scale

Use this scale to evaluate any output's typicality:

| Level | Definition | AI Generation Probability | Example (SaaS pricing redesign) |
|-------|-----------|--------------------------|--------------------------------|
| **High** | First association, template response | >60% | "3-tier table with Free/Pro/Enterprise" |
| **Medium** | Slight twist, but still familiar | 30-60% | "Usage-based pricing with calculator widget" |
| **Low** | Unexpected but coherent | 10-30% | "Price revealed only after value demonstration" |
| **Lowest** | Structurally novel, challenges assumptions | <10% | "Customer sets own price; margin shared transparently" |

**Mandate:** Final output must target **Low** or **Lowest**. If everything is Medium or above, run the protocol again with different Killer Constraint.

---

## 5. Cross-Domain Analogy Engine

To further break the mold, force analogies from distant domains:

### Procedure
1. Identify the problem domain (e.g., "SaaS onboarding")
2. Select 2 domains from the rotation list that are **maximally distant**:
   - biology, urban planning, game design, culinary arts, military strategy, music composition, sports coaching, theatrical production, logistics, behavioral psychology, architecture, astronomy
3. For each distant domain, extract **1 structural principle** that maps to the problem
4. Generate 1 solution idea per analogy
5. Evaluate these alongside the Divergence 5-Step results

### Example
**Problem:** "How to reduce customer churn in a subscription app"
- **Biology → Symbiosis:** Make the product more valuable when used alongside the customer's existing tools (mutualistic integration)
- **Game Design → Progress Visibility:** Show users a persistent progression system that would be lost on cancellation (sunk-cost + achievement mechanics)
- **Killer Constraint:** "Must cost <$50K and ship in 2 sprints"

### Integration with 5-Step
- Analogy-derived ideas count toward the 5 candidates in Step 1
- If an analogy-derived idea survives to Step 3, it gets priority (structural novelty is inherently high)
- If both analogy ideas are discarded in Step 2, note why — this reveals constraints you haven't articulated

## 6. Anti-Patterns (How This Goes Wrong)

| Anti-Pattern | Symptom | Fix |
|-------------|---------|-----|
| **Random ≠ Novel** | Output is bizarre but structurally conventional underneath | Check: is the *structure* new, or just the *wrapping*? |
| **Constraint Theater** | Killer Constraint is technically satisfied but the output is still typical | Make constraints attack the *core assumption*, not surface features |
| **Analogy Skin-Deep** | Distant domain reference is metaphorical only, no structural transfer | Extract the *mechanism*, not the *label*. "Like biology" ≠ structural transfer |
| **Rejection Without Replacement** | Discarding 3 candidates but the remaining 2 are also typical | If all 5 are typical, the problem framing itself is the mold. Reframe the question |
| **Novelty Without Utility** | Structurally novel but completely impractical | Every selected candidate must have a concrete first step |

## 7. Integration with Other Protocols

### GHOSTY COLLIDER → MOLD BREAKER Pipeline
1. Run GHOSTY COLLIDER to produce Visions
2. Take each Vision as a "candidate" in MOLD BREAKER Step 1
3. Apply the Rejection/Selection/Constraint process to push Visions past their initial form
4. Result: Visions that are both structurally emergent (from GHOSTY) AND typicality-free (from MOLD BREAKER)

### PRECOG PROTOCOL → MOLD BREAKER Pipeline
1. Run PRECOG PROTOCOL to produce Action Windows
2. Apply MOLD BREAKER to the specific actions in each window
3. Killer Constraint: "This action must be something no competitor would recognize as a competitive move"
